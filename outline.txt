The primary goal is to write 10 pages on deep learning, skip introduction, historical development, and conclusion.

**For the primary goal, you will focus on the following**:
- Write a very technical explanation of deep learning.
- Explain the difference between deep learning and other machine learning methods.
- Explain the use of neural networks in deep learning.
- Explain the mathematical notation used in deep learning.

**Requirements**:
- Ensure all content is well-researched and cited in APA style.
- Include a comprehensive reference table at the end of the document.
- Do not return a bullet point list of the requirements. Instead, write a well-structured and coherent chapter that meets the requirements.
- Do not return a plagiarized document.
- Do NOT write code, but instead focus on explaining the model architectures and use mathematical notation when necessary. 
- Write all mathematical notation in LaTeX.
