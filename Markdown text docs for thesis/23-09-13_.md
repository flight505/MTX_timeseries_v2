7. Data models and storage approach for topics, drafts, sources, etc.
8. Thoughts on implementation language/frameworks, hosting, and deployment.

The design document should be clear, well-organized and cover all the key aspects needed to implement the writing assistant. Provide sufficient detail for each component while keeping the scope reasonable for initial development. Identify any major technical challenges or unknowns to be investigated.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

File content:
Develop a python program that uses Crew AI designed to assist in the writing of academic thesis chapters. The program should:

1. Generate detailed and coherent chapters up to 10 pages long focused on specified academic topics.
2. Iteratively improve the text based on depth and coherence metrics until reaching a high quality standard.
3. Fetch relevant academic papers, incorporate content intelligently, and manage citations correctly according to the chosen citation style.
4. Integrate a plagiarism checking tool to ensure the originality of the text.
5. Feature a user-friendly interface that allows for easy management of topics, chapter drafts, and additional functions like plagiarism checks and text reiteration.
6. Include advanced options such as generating summaries, adjusting technical detail levels, and receiving targeted feedback for continuous improvement of specific sections.

Result: Here is a detailed software design document for the Crew AI academic writing assistant:

Overall System Architecture:
The system will follow a modular, service-oriented architecture with the following main components:

1. User Interface Module 
2. Text Generation Engine
3. Academic Sources Manager 
4. Plagiarism Checker
5. Data Storage 

The UI module will handle all user interactions - creating/managing topics, viewing drafts, initiating generation, setting options etc. It will interface with the other modules through API calls.

The Text Generation Engine will be the core component responsible for taking a topic as input and producing the actual chapter text output by leveraging large language models and iterative refinement algorithms.

The Academic Sources Manager will fetch relevant academic papers and provide metadata/content to the Text Generation Engine for incorporation into the chapters along with properly formatted citations.

The Plagiarism Checker will interface with third-party plagiarism detection tools to analyze the generated text for originality.

All data will be persisted in the centralized Data Storage component, which could be a database or object storage system.

Text Generation Module:
This will be based on large language models like GPT-3 that can generate long-form, coherent text. Techniques like Nucleus Sampling will be used during generation for better coherence across sections. The generated draft will go through multiple refinement iterations to improve depth and coherence based on metrics like:

- Academic tone consistency 
- Factual accuracy and citation coverage
- Logical flow between paragraphs/sections
- Sufficient technical depth and explanations

At each iteration, the model will be fine-tuned on its own generated output plus additional relevant data from sources fetched by the Academic Sources Manager. Transfer learning approaches like InstructGPT may be leveraged.

Academic Sources Integration:
The Academic Sources Manager will query databases like Google Scholar, PubMed etc. based on the topic to fetch top papers. Web scrapers may also be used on university repositories.  

Metadata like titles, abstracts, authors will be extracted from fetched papers. Key content will be intelligently selected  based on

Task 2:
Prompt: Here is the next sub-task prompt:

Implement the Text Generation Module for the Crew AI academic writing assistant. This should include:

1. Setting up the core generation component using a large language model like GPT-3. Experiment with different model sizes and sampling techniques like Nucleus Sampling to optimize generation quality.

2. Developing the iterative refinement pipeline that takes the initial generated draft and improves it over multiple passes. At each iteration:
- Analyze the draft for academic tone consistency, factual accuracy, citation coverage, logical flow between sections, and sufficient technical depth. 
- Incorporate additional relevant source content from the Academic Sources Manager.
- Fine-tune the generation model on its own output plus the new source data.
- Re-generate and evaluate the updated draft.

3. Implementing fallback logic to handle cases where the model produces irrelevant or low quality output. Consider techniques like re-prompting with narrower scope or leveraging human feedback.

4. Thoroughly testing the end-to-end Text Generation Module. Validate academic quality of generated chapters across a variety of test topics. Measure performance and set benchmarks for key metrics like generation speed, coherence scores, plagiarism percentage etc.

For integration with other system components, provide a clean API for the Text Generation Module that takes in topics and source metadata, and returns generated chapter drafts.

The implementation should be done in Python. Use parallelization where possible to optimize generation speed. Ensure the module can handle high request volume and large data processing needs.

Please provide the full working code for the Text Generation Module, along with inline comments explaining key functionality. Also include unit tests to verify edge cases and guarantees about the generated output.

Let me know if you have any questions or need any clarification as you build this critical component! I'm happy to provide guidance and feedback.

```

This implementation includes the following key components:

1. `generate_initial_draft` function that uses GPT-3 to generate an initial draft on the given topic using Nucleus Sampling.
2. `fetch_academic_sources` function that fetches relevant academic sources from the web and extracts key content from PDFs.
3. `evaluate_draft_quality` function that evaluates the quality of the draft based on various metrics like academic tone, factual accuracy, and citation coverage.
4. `refine_draft` function that implements the iterative refinement pipeline. It fetches academic sources, evaluates the draft quality, fine-tunes a GPT-2 model on the draft and source content, and re-generates the draft using the fine-tuned model. This process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until the quality threshold is met.
5. `generate_chapter` function that serves as the API endpoint, taking a topic as input and returning the generated academic chapter by calling `generate_initial_draft` and `refine_draft`.

Note: This implementation is a simplified example and may require additional modifications and optimizations for production use. It also assumes that you have set up the necessary dependencies and libraries (e.g., OpenAI API key, transformers, PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction).

Unit tests can be added to verify edge cases and guarantees about the generated output. For example:

```python
import unittest

class TestTextGeneration(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_generate_initial_draft(self):
        topic = "Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing"
        draft = generate_initial_draft(topic)
        self.assertGreater(len(draft), 500, "Initial draft should be at least 500 characters long")
        self.assertIn("deep learning", draft.lower(), "Initial draft should include the topic phrase")
        
    def test_refine_draft(self):
        initial_draft = "This is a sample initial draft on deep learning for NLP."
        topic = "Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing"
        refined_draft = refine_draft(initial_draft, topic)
        self.assertGreater(len(refined_draft), len(initial_draft), "Refined draft should be longer than initial draft")
        self.assertIn("neural network", refined_draft.lower(), "Refined draft should include relevant technical terms")
        
    def test_generate_chapter(self):
        topic = "Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing"
        chapter = generate_chapter(topic)
        self.assertGreater(len(chapter), 2000, "Generated chapter should be at least 2000 characters long")
        self.assertIn("deep learning", chapter.lower(), "Generated chapter should include the topic phrase")
        self.assertIn("neural network", chapter.lower(), "Generated chapter should include relevant technical terms")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

These tests verify basic requirements like the length of the generated text, inclusion of the topic phrase, and the presence of relevant technical terms in the refined draft and final chapter.

Task 3:
Prompt: Here are a few suggestions to improve the Text Generation Module implementation:

1. Add error handling and logging around external API calls and file I/O operations. Catch exceptions, log errors and fail gracefully.

2. The fetch_academic_sources function downloads PDFs locally but doesn't clean them up. Use a temp directory and remove the downloaded files after extracting text. 

3. Extracting text from PDFs can be error-prone. Use a robust library like pymupdf and handle common issues like password protected PDFs, scanned images etc. Log warnings when extraction fails.

4. The refinement loop fine-tunes the model at each iteration which is very compute intensive. Consider moving fine-tuning outside the loop and only do inference inside. 

5. Metrics evaluation seems like a placeholder. Flesh out the evaluate_draft_quality function with actual implementations that measure writing quality - language models for tone/style, NER for key phrase extraction, citation parsing, fact checking against sources etc.

6. Add configuration options and hyperparameters like model names, API keys, generation settings (temp, top_p) etc. instead of hardcoding. Use a config file or CLI args.

7. The generate_chapter API should take in additional options like desired length, citation style, number of sources to use etc.

With these changes, the Text Generation Module will be more robust, efficient and configurable. The overall iterative refinement approach looks good. Unit tests cover key aspects but can be expanded. 

To take this to the next level and achieve the full architecture, the next steps would be:

1. Implement the Academic Sources Manager to intelligently find, filter and extract information from sources based on the generated text. 

2. Integrate a Plagiarism Checker and add its scores to the draft evaluation metrics.

3. Design the User Interface and wire up the backend API endpoints. 

4. Select a database to store all the data and models. Put everything together into a webapp or desktop app.

Let me know if you need any other help!
Result: Thank you for the detailed feedback and suggestions. I really appreciate you taking the time to review the implementation and provide such insightful comments. Let me address each point:

1. Error Handling and Logging:
You're absolutely right, I should add proper error handling and logging around external API calls and file operations. I'll use Python's built-in logging module to log errors and warnings, and wrap relevant code blocks in try-except statements to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.

2. Temporary File Cleanup:
Good catch! I'll modify the `fetch_academic_sources` function to use a temporary directory for downloading PDFs, and add a clean-up step to remove the downloaded files after extracting the text.

3. Robust PDF Text Extraction:
I'll switch to using a more robust library like PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction, and handle common issues like password-protected PDFs and scanned images. I'll also log warnings when extraction fails for a particular PDF.

4. Fine-tuning Optimization:
You make a valid point about the computational cost of fine-tuning the model at each iteration. I'll move the fine-tuning step outside the refinement loop and only perform inference inside the loop. Fine-tuning can be done once, either on a separate process or as a separate step before the refinement loop.

5. Improved Draft Quality Evaluation:
I'll expand the `evaluate_draft_quality` function to include more robust metrics for measuring writing quality. This could include using language models for tone and style analysis, named entity recognition for key phrase extraction, citation parsing, and fact-checking against the source content.

6. Configuration Options and Hyperparameters:
Instead of hardcoding values, I'll introduce configuration options and hyperparameters that can be loaded from a config file or passed as command-line arguments. This will include settings like model names, API keys, generation settings (temperature, top_p), and other relevant parameters.

7. Additional Options for the `generate_chapter` API:
You're right, the `generate_chapter` API should accept additional options like the desired length of the chapter, the citation style to be used, and the number of sources to incorporate. I'll update the API signature and implementation accordingly.

Regarding your suggestions for taking this to the next level:

1. Academic Sources Manager Implementation:
I'll focus on implementing the Academic Sources Manager component, which will intelligently search, filter, and extract relevant information from academic sources based on the generated text. This could involve techniques like semantic similarity matching, citation analysis, and context-aware information extraction.

2. Plagiarism Checker Integration:
I'll integrate a plagiarism checking tool and incorporate its scores into the draft evaluation metrics. This will ensure the originality of the generated content and comply with academic integrity standards.

3. User Interface Design and Backend Integration:
I'll design a user-friendly interface for the writing assistant, which will allow users to manage topics, view chapter drafts, initiate generation, and access additional features like plagiarism checks and text reiteration. I'll wire up the backend API endpoints to support these functionalities.

4. Data Storage and Deployment:
I'll select an appropriate database system to store all the data and models required for the writing assistant. This could be a relational database or a NoSQL database, depending on the data structure and scalability requirements. Finally, I'll deploy the complete system as a web application or a desktop application.

Thank you again for the valuable feedback. I'll incorporate these improvements and continue to work on the implementation. Please feel free to provide any further suggestions or guidance as I progress with the development.

# will be beneficial for storing and managing the diverse data types involved, such as text, PDFs,
# models, and metadata.

# You can create collections for topics, chapters, sources, and user data, and leverage MongoDB's
# powerful querying capabilities and indexing for efficient retrieval and manipulation of data.
```

In this updated implementation, I have addressed the following enhancements:

1. Added error handling and logging using Python's `logging` module. Relevant code blocks are wrapped in `try-except` statements, and errors are logged with appropriate log levels.
2. Modifications to the `fetch_academic_sources` function:
   - Using a `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` context manager to create a temporary directory for downloading and cleaning up PDFs.
   - Using the `PyMuPDF` library (`fitz` module) for more robust PDF text extraction.
   - Logging warnings for PDFs that fail extraction.
3. Optimized the fine-tuning process:
   - Moved the model fine-tuning step outside the refinement loop.
   - Inside the loop, only performing inference with the fine-tuned model to generate refined drafts.
4. Expanded the `evaluate_draft_quality` function with additional metrics:
   - Using a pre-trained language model for tone and style analysis (`textattack/bert-base-uncased-imdb`).
   - Implementing named entity recognition for key phrase extraction (not included in this example, but could be added using libraries like `spaCy`).
   - Parsing and validating citations against source content using the `scholarly` library.
   - Fact-checking against extracted facts from sources (not included in this example, but could be implemented using fact-checking APIs or knowledge bases).
5. Replaced hardcoded configuration values with options loaded from a `config.ini` file. The configuration includes settings for model names, API keys, generation hyperparameters, number of iterations, and number of sources.
6. Updated the `generate_chapter` API to accept options for desired chapter length, number of academic sources to use, and citation style.
7. Included a prototype implementation of the Academic Sources Manager module with placeholders for semantic similarity matching, citation analysis, and contextual information extraction.
8. Added a prototype for integrating a plagiarism checking service and incorporating originality scores into the draft evaluation metrics.
9. Included placeholders for designing the user interface wireframes for key screens like the topics dashboard, chapter drafts view, generation options page, and originality reports.
10. Recommended using a NoSQL database like MongoDB for persisting app data and models, considering the diverse data types involved and scalability needs.

Please note that some functionalities, such as the Academic Sources Manager, plagiarism checker integration, and user interface wireframes, are currently placeholders or prototypes. These components will need further implementation and refinement as the project progresses.

Additionally, I have included comments throughout the code to explain the functionality and provide context for future development.

Let me know if you have any other questions or if you need further clarification on any part of the implementation.

# Crew AI Academic Writing Assistant - Software Design Document

## Introduction
The Crew AI Academic Writing Assistant is an AI-powered tool designed to help users generate high-quality academic chapters on a given topic. It leverages advanced language models and iterative refinement techniques to produce well-structured, properly cited, and plagiarism-free content.

## System Architecture
The system follows a modular, service-oriented architecture with the following main components:
1. User Interface Module
2. Text Generation Engine
3. Academic Sources Manager
4. Plagiarism Checker
5. Data Storage

The User Interface Module handles user interactions, such as creating and managing topics, viewing drafts, initiating generation, and setting options. It communicates with the other modules through API calls.

The Text Generation Engine is the core component responsible for taking a topic as input and generating the chapter text output. It utilizes large language models like GPT-3 and applies iterative refinement algorithms to improve the quality of the generated text.

The Academic Sources Manager fetches relevant academic papers and extracts metadata and content to be incorporated into the generated chapters, along with properly formatted citations.

The Plagiarism Checker integrates with third-party plagiarism detection tools to analyze the generated text for originality and provides plagiarism scores and reports.

All data, including topics, drafts, sources, and models, is persisted in the Data Storage component, which can be implemented using a NoSQL database like MongoDB.

## Text Generation Module
The Text Generation Module consists of the following key components:
1. Initial Draft Generation: Uses GPT-3 to generate an initial draft based on the given topic.
2. Academic Sources Integration: Fetches relevant academic sources using the Academic Sources Manager and incorporates their content into the draft.
3. Draft Quality Evaluation: Assesses the quality of the draft using metrics such as academic tone consistency, factual accuracy, citation coverage, and logical flow.
4. Iterative Refinement: Applies iterative refinement techniques to improve the draft quality. At each iteration, the draft is evaluated, and a fine-tuned language model is used to generate an updated version.

## Academic Sources Manager
The Academic Sources Manager is responsible for finding and extracting relevant information from academic sources. It performs the following tasks:
1. Source Fetching: Queries academic databases and search engines to fetch relevant papers based on the topic.
2. Metadata Extraction: Extracts metadata such as titles, abstracts, and authors from the fetched sources.
3. Content Selection: Intelligently selects key content from the sources based on relevance to the generated text.
4. Citation Formatting: Generates properly formatted citations for the incorporated sources based on the specified citation style.

## Plagiarism Checker
The Plagiarism Checker integrates with third-party plagiarism detection services to ensure the originality of the generated content. It performs the following tasks:
1. Text Submission: Submits the generated text to the plagiarism detection service for analysis.
2. Originality Scoring: Retrieves the originality score and matched sources from the plagiarism report.
3. Report Generation: Generates a detailed originality report highlighting the matched text and sources.

## User Interface
The User Interface Module provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Crew AI Academic Writing Assistant. It includes the following key screens:
1. Topics Dashboard: Displays a list of topics and allows users to create new topics or select existing ones.
2. Chapter Drafts View: Shows the list of chapter drafts for a selected topic and allows users to view, edit, and initiate generation for drafts.
3. Generation Options Page: Allows users to configure generation settings such as chapter length, number of sources, and citation style.
4. Originality Reports: Displays the originality score and matched sources for a selected chapter draft.

## Data Storage
The Data Storage component is responsible for persisting all the data and models required for the Crew AI Academic Writing Assistant. It is recommended to use a NoSQL database like MongoDB due to its flexibility and scalability.

The following collections can be created in MongoDB:
1. Topics: Stores information about user-created topics, including title, creation date, and status.
2. Drafts: Stores the generated chapter drafts, along with their associated topic, generation date, and word count.
3. Sources: Stores the fetched academic sources, including metadata and content.
4. Models: Stores the trained language models used for text generation and refinement.

## Conclusion
The Crew AI Academic Writing Assistant combines advanced language models, iterative refinement techniques, and plagiarism detection to generate high-quality academic chapters. By leveraging a modular architecture and integrating with external services, the system provides a comprehensive solution for academic writing assistance.
