The digitization of medical data is an important driving force for applying modern machine learning technologies to promote clinical research and healthcare quality [149, 33]. The application of Electronic Health Record (EHR) in clinical care started around the 1960s [33]. Before that, patient records were written in paper format, which made it difficult to learn the pattern of disease development from a large patient cohort [149]. As a result, paper-based medical records were not effective at promoting clinical research or supporting treatment decision making [33]. In recent years, EHR systems have been widely adopted in hospitals and healthcare centers, 1 producing large amounts and various types of medical data, including basic health data (e.g., birthdate, gender, height, and weight), disease diagnoses, medical treatments, laboratory parameters, and medical imaging [67, 37, 62, 79, 29, 106, 111]. Among them, time-stamped sequential health data, e.g., laboratory parameters [98, 123, 80, 110] and clinical events [91, 54, 82], are especially important because they can provide rich information on the dynamic changes in the health conditions of patients along time, providing valuable opportunities for researchers to develop advanced data-driven approaches to extract the patterns of disease changing trend from the historical health records of patients and predict the potential clinical events and risks [163, 2]. In summary, the large-scale digitization of medical data makes it possible to develop machine learning approaches to learn useful diagnosis patterns from a large scale of patient records, perform clinical predictions, and more importantly in turn assist doctors to design more effective treatments to improve the final clinical outcomes.
According to whether health data has temporal property, EHR data can be divided into two categories. The first category is static data, e.g., basic health data
[67, 37, 62, 187, 56, 107], such as birthdate, gender, and height, which provides the background health status of patients and demonstrate their personal immune abilities [148], or one single medical imaging, which can provide the health conditions of an organ or tissue at a certain time point [119, 5, 178, 16]. This type of health data is relatively easy to measure and record because of the relatively strong regularity, and therefore can be conveniently modeled by most machine learning models, such as Logistic regression [74], Ridge regression [51], and Convolutional neural networks (CNN) [185, 17]. Therefore, this kind of data has long been used for estimating the health conditions of patients, especially in medical research areas [28, 179, 159]. However, because this type of data only contains the health information at one single time, which is incapable of reflecting the dynamic changes in the disease severities of patients along time, models built upon this data often suffer from limited performances at predicting the future clinical outcomes.
The second category is dynamic health data, including laboratory parameters [98, 123, 80, 110] and clinical events [91, 54, 82], which respectively provide information on the changes in the values of physiological variables over time and indicate whether certain clinical events happen at different time stamps [136, 7, 69, 50, 47]. Compared with static data, dynamic medical data can provide more useful information on the dynamic changes in the health conditions of patients. Therefore, a large number of machine learning models [167, 101, 56, 107], especially deep learning neural networks [26, 95, 68, 89, 130], have been built for the analysis of dynamic medical data to perform different clinical prediction tasks [167, 101], including patient mortality risk prediction [152, 54, 136, 7, 161, 1], patient subtyping [166, 183], disease prediction [186, 171, 138], length-of-stay prediction [4, 130], early detection of disease [27, 134], and clinical decision making [151]. However, these methods are often designed for regular medical time-series data, thus cannot be applied to the real-world EHR
data, which is usually irregularly sampled. Therefore, how to effectively capture temporal dependencies information from real-world irregular EHR data and utilize the learned information to achieve accurate clinical prediction results and improve clinical outcomes have become a hot topic in recent years [89, 121, 24, 169].

Result: I've analyzed the provided text, and here are my suggestions for improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and flow:

1. The second paragraph starts abruptly with "According to whether health data has temporal property..." Consider adding a transition sentence at the beginning of this paragraph to connect it better with the previous one.

2. The sentence "Compared with static data, dynamic medical data can provide more useful information on the dynamic changes in the health conditions of patients." is a bit repetitive. Consider rephrasing it to avoid redundancy.

3. The last sentence of the third paragraph is quite long and complex. Consider breaking it down into two or more sentences for better readability.

4. The overall flow of the text could be improved by adding subheadings or section breaks to better organize the different topics covered.

Additionally, here are the summaries of 3 highly relevant scientific papers published since 2020 that explain state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for modeling irregular time series data in healthcare, with a focus on Electronic Health Records:

Introduction
The digitization of medical data has been a significant driving force for applying modern machine learning technologies to promote clinical research and healthcare quality [149, 33]. The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems in hospitals and healthcare centers has produced large amounts and various types of medical data, including basic health data, disease diagnoses, medical treatments, laboratory parameters, and medical imaging [67, 37, 62, 79, 29, 106, 111]. Among these, time-stamped sequential health data, such as laboratory parameters [98, 123, 80, 110] and clinical events [91, 54, 82], are particularly important as they provide rich information on the dynamic changes in patients' health conditions over time. This valuable data enables researchers to develop advanced data-driven approaches to extract patterns of disease progression from historical patient records and predict potential clinical events and risks [163, 2]. The large-scale digitization of medical data has made it possible to develop machine learning approaches that learn useful diagnostic patterns from a large scale of patient records, perform clinical predictions, and assist doctors in designing more effective treatments to improve clinical outcomes.

Types of Medical Data

Static Data
The first category of medical data is static data, which includes basic health information [67, 37, 62, 187, 56, 107], such as birthdate, gender, and height, as well as single medical images that provide a snapshot of an organ or tissue's health condition at a specific time point [119, 5, 178, 16]. This type of data is relatively easy to measure and record due to its strong regularity and can be conveniently modeled by most machine learning models, such as Logistic regression [74], Ridge regression [51], and Convolutional neural networks (CNN) [185, 17]. As a result, static data has long been used for estimating patients' health conditions, especially in medical research areas [28, 179, 159]. However, since this type of data only captures health information at a single time point, it cannot reflect the dynamic changes in patients' disease severities over time, limiting the accuracy of models built upon this data in predicting future clinical outcomes.

Dynamic Data
The second category is dynamic health data, which includes laboratory parameters [98, 123, 80, 110] and clinical events [91, 54, 82]. These data types provide information on changes in physiological variables over time and indicate the occurrence of certain clinical events at different time stamps [136, 7, 69, 50, 47]. Dynamic medical data offers valuable insights into patients' evolving health conditions. Many machine learning models [167, 101, 56, 107], especially deep learning neural networks [26, 95, 68, 89, 130], have been developed to analyze dynamic medical data and perform various clinical prediction tasks [167, 101], such as patient mortality risk prediction [152, 54, 136, 7, 161, 1], patient subtyping [166, 183], disease prediction [186, 171, 138], length-of-stay prediction [4, 130], early detection of disease [27, 134], and clinical decision making [151]. However, these methods are often designed for regular medical time-series data and cannot be directly applied to real-world EHR data, which is usually irregularly sampled. Effectively capturing temporal dependencies from irregular EHR data and utilizing the learned information to achieve accurate clinical predictions and improve clinical outcomes has become a hot topic in recent years [89, 121, 24, 169].
