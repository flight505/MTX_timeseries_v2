Deep Learning for Modeling Irregularly Sampled EHR Time Series in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

I. Introduction

Electronic health records (EHRs) have emerged as a rich source of data for understanding disease trajectories and informing clinical decision making. However, EHR data poses unique challenges due to its irregular sampling patterns, with measurements like lab tests and vital signs often collected at inconsistent intervals. This irregularity violates the assumptions of traditional time series models and motivates the development of new deep learning approaches capable of handling irregular sequences. 

In this work, we focus on the application of deep learning to model irregularly sampled EHR data for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), an aggressive blood cancer that is the most common pediatric malignancy. Accurate modeling of ALL patients' longitudinal EHR data can enable improved monitoring of disease status, forecasting of adverse events, and planning of therapeutic interventions. By leveraging recent advances in deep learning for irregular time series, we aim to extract insights from ALL EHR sequences that can ultimately enhance treatment and care.

We provide an overview of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures tailored for irregular time series modeling, including recurrent neural networks, temporal convolutional networks, and hybrid attention-based models. We then discuss their application to ALL patient EHR data, covering key aspects such as data preprocessing, model evaluation metrics, interpretability methods, and potential clinical use cases. Finally, we highlight ethical considerations and future research directions in this important domain at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare.

II. Background

A. Electronic Health Records
Electronic health records (EHRs) are comprehensive digital repositories containing a patient's medical history, including diagnoses, treatments, lab results, medications, and more. The widespread adoption of EHR systems has unlocked new opportunities for data-driven clinical research and predictive modeling. However, EHR data poses unique challenges compared to traditional clinical trial datasets:

1. Irregular sampling: Measurements like lab tests and vital signs are often collected at inconsistent intervals based on a patient's condition and clinician judgment, rather than fixed time points.

2. Missing data: Due to the nature of clinical practice, certain data elements may be frequently missing for a variety of reasons.

3. Data heterogeneity: EHR data contains a multitude of distinct data types (numerical, text, time series, etc.) that require specialized handling.

B. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood, characterized by an overproduction of immature white blood cells called lymphoblasts. While treatments like chemotherapy have improved prognosis, ALL remains associated with high mortality rates and severe side effects. There is a pressing need for more personalized and adaptive treatment strategies informed by each patient's clinical trajectory.

Modeling the longitudinal EHR data of ALL patients can provide insights into disease progression, treatment response, and risk of adverse events. However, the irregularly sampled nature of EHR sequences poses challenges for conventional time series methods. Deep learning offers a promising solution for extracting predictive signals from these irregular multivariate clinical time series.

C. Traditional Time Series Modeling
Traditional statistical methods for time series analysis and forecasting, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, assume regularly spaced observations collected at fixed intervals. These approaches struggle with the presence of arbitrary gaps and missing data points that are common in EHR sequences.

To handle irregularity, ad-hoc techniques like interpolation, imputation, or binning the data into fixed windows are often employed. However, these workarounds are sub-optimal as they discard potentially useful information contained in the irregular sampling patterns. More fundamentally, traditional time series models often fail to capture long-range dependencies and complex non-linear patterns that may be critical for accurate clinical predictive modeling.

III. Deep Learning for Irregular Time Series 

Recent years have seen a surge of novel deep learning architectures designed to explicitly handle irregularly sampled time series data across domains like healthcare, finance, and sensor networks. These models leverage neural network components like recurrent cells, convolutional layers, and attention mechanisms in innovative ways to flexibly model arbitrary time lags while extracting relevant patterns.

A. Recurrent Neural Network Models
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted for sequence modeling tasks due to their ability to maintain an internal hidden state that encodes historical information. For handling irregular time series, the time gap between observations can be provided as an additional input feature to the RNN, allowing it to dynamically update its hidden state across arbitrary time lags.

Two prominent RNN variants that have shown strong performance on irregular sequences are:

1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
LSTMs introduce a gating mechanism to their recurrent cells, which helps alleviate the vanishing/exploding gradient issues that plagued traditional RNNs. This enhanced memory capacity makes LSTMs well-suited for learning long-range dependencies present in clinical time series data spanning months or years.

As described in the review paper "A Review of Deep Learning Methods for Irregularly Sampled Medical Time Series Data" (Sun et al, 2021), LSTM-based models have been successfully applied to several tasks involving irregularly sampled EHR data, such as disease progression modeling and biomarker forecasting.

2. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
The GRU is a more lightweight recurrent unit that combines the forget and input gates of an LSTM into a single update gate. While slightly less expressive than LSTMs, GRUs are faster to train and have seen widespread adoption in sequence modeling.

For handling irregular sampling, GRUs employ the same time gap encoding approach as LSTMs, dynamically adjusting their hidden state updates based on the temporal distances between observations.

B. Temporal Convolutional Networks
While recurrent architectures are a natural fit for sequence data, they often suffer from computational bottlenecks during training due to their sequential nature. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) present an alternative path for sequence modeling with greater parallelization.

Temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) adapt the convolution operation from images to 1D sequences, allowing them to extract local patterns through the convolution kernels while maintaining temporal relationships. To handle irregular sampling, recent TCN variants employ dynamic dilations that skip over the gaps between observations.

The paper "Irregular sampling occurs..." (Multi paper, 2020) proposes Multi-Time Window Convolutional Neural Networks that use multiple dilation scales to capture patterns at different timescales, enabling robust modeling of multiscale irregularities in time series data.

C. Hybrid Attention-Based Models
Another promising direction combines the capabilities of RNNs and CNNs with attention mechanisms that allow the model to dynamically focus on the most relevant patterns and time points across the input sequence. Several hybrid architectures integrating attention have emerged:

1. Transformer-based Models
The transformer model introduced for natural language tasks has been adapted for time series forecasting. In the paper "Transformer Model for Irregularly Sampled Time Series Forecasting" (Ding et al., 2022), the authors propose an encoder-decoder transformer that uses positional encoding and causal masking to handle arbitrary time lags and generate future predictions autoregressively.

The Informer model (Zhou et al., 2021) combines self-attention with parallel decoding and frequency domain operations to enhance efficiency for long sequence forecasting tasks while capturing long-range dependencies.

2. Attention-Augmented ConvLSTM
As described in "An Attention-Augmented ConvLSTM for Time Series Prediction" (Liu et al., 2020), this architecture integrates convolutional layers for extracting local temporal patterns, LSTM cells for learning longer-range dependencies, and an attention component that determines which patterns to prioritize for each time step. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness on various irregularly sampled sensor datasets.

While these architectures show strong empirical performance, challenges remain in areas like handling multiscale irregularities spanning widely varying time periods, efficiently modeling long-range dependencies over years of data, and scaling to the massive datasets involved in healthcare applications.

IV. Application to ALL Treatment and Monitoring

A. Data Sources and Preprocessing
To develop deep learning models for ALL patients using EHR data, we can leverage several potential data sources:

Disease Registries: Large-scale cancer registries like the Pediatric Cancer Data Commons and SEER-Medicare databases contain curated EHR data from patients across multiple institutions, though access is often restricted.

Individual Hospital Systems: With appropriate data sharing agreements and privacy controls in place, individual hospital networks can provide rich longitudinal EHR data for ALL patients under their care. For example, the study "Predicting Clinical Phenotypes in Pediatric ALL Using Machine Learning" (Crawford et al., 2021) extracted data from their institutional EHR.

Key characteristics of ALL patient EHR data that require careful preprocessing include:

- Irregular sampling of lab tests (e.g. blood counts), vital signs, treatments
- Varying sequences/channels of data available for each patient 
- Presence of missing data, data quality issues

Necessary preprocessing steps include:

- Data cleaning to remove errors and inconsistencies 
- Handling missing data through imputation, masking, time series-aware interpolation
- Encoding varying data types (text, numerics, etc.) into ML-friendly representations
- Aligning heterogeneous sequences onto consistent time grids while preserving irregularity

The Crawford et al. paper provides a relevant example, detailing their extensive data cleaning, normalization, encoding, and imputation procedures before applying machine learning models to predict high-risk phenotypes.

B. Model Architecture and Training
To adapt the deep learning models discussed in Section III to modeling ALL patient EHR data, several architectural choices must be made:

Input Representation: Determining how to encode the multivariate irregularly sampled time series sequences, including time gap representations, missing data handling, etc.

Model Components: Selecting the core components like RNNs, CNNs, attention modules based on characteristics of the data (e.g. sequence lengths, degree of missing data). Hybrid models may be appropriate.

Output Targets: Formulating predictions tasks based on clinical needs - forecasting future biomarker trajectories, predicting time-to-event for adverse outcomes, etc.

During training, techniques like curriculum learning (sorting sequences from shortest to longest), gradient clipping, and judicious hyperparameter tuning (e.g. for regularization strength) are often required to achieve stable convergence on this challenging data.

C. Evaluation Metrics 
To comprehensively evaluate the performance of deep learning models on irregularly sampled ALL EHR sequences, a combination of general and domain-specific evaluation metrics should be adopted:

General Time Series Metrics:
- Accuracy metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE 
- Probabilistic scores: Negative log-likelihood, continuous ranked probability score (CRPS)

Clinical Evaluation:
- Area under ROC/precision-recall curves for event prediction tasks (e.g. relapse)
- Hazard ratios, concordance indices for time-to-event outcomes
- Domain-specific metrics like biomarker forecasting errors based on clinician feedback

Comparing held-out performance to clinical baselines and traditional statistical models is crucial for demonstrating practical utility.

D. Interpretability and Clinical Applications
While deep neural networks are powerful predictive models, they are often criticized as opaque "black boxes" lacking explanatory capabilities. This proves problematic in risk-sensitive healthcare domains where clinicians should understand what patterns/features drive a model's output to ensure trust and safety.

To provide insight into deep learning models for ALL EHR sequences, established techniques like:

- Saliency maps, attention visualizations
- Subset/feature importance scoring 
- Counterfactual explanations through input perturbations

can be leveraged to probe what patterns in the irregularly sampled time series the model focuses on.

With interpretability methods to understand their inner workings, deep learning models for ALL EHR data unlock a variety of high-impact clinical applications:

Disease Trajectory Monitoring & Forecasting: Generating timely risk scores and accurate forecasts of disease progression and relapse by integrating the full longitudinal record.  

Treatment Planning & Decision Support: Using predicted biomarker trajectories and risk profiles to develop personalized therapeutic strategies that account for patient specifics.

Early Warning for Adverse Events: Alerting clinicians to elevated risk of complications like febrile neutropenia based on multivariate EHR patterns for timely interventions.

Biomarker/Lab Imputation: Leveraging the model's ability to learn patterns in irregularly sampled lab tests to impute missing values in a data-driven manner instead of simplistic ad-hoc imputation.

Overall, deep learning models tailored for irregular time series have the potential to unlock predictive insights from the richness of EHR data, leading to more proactive, personalized ALL treatment plans and improved outcomes.

V. Ethics and Future Work

A. Ethical Considerations
Despite the clinical potential of deep learning for modeling EHR data, critical ethical issues must be carefully navigated:

Patient Privacy & Data Security: EHR data contains highly sensitive personal health information. Development and deployment of deep learning systems in this domain must rigorously follow data privacy laws and regulations like HIPAA. Emerging technical approaches like differential privacy, federated learning, and secure multi-party computation should be leveraged.

The paper "Ethical AI in Healthcare" (Finlayson et al., 2022) provides guidelines balancing responsible EHR data usage while maintaining individual privacy and consent.  

Fairness, Bias & Trust in Medical AI: Like other fields, medical AI systems must be carefully audited for sources of bias that could lead to discriminatory or unfair predictions. Deep learning models should strive to provide clear documentation of their decision-making process and avenues for recourse to cultivate clinician trust.

Deployment Risks & Validation: AI systems applied to healthcare introduce new risks around operational and data distribution shifts over time. Robust processes must validate continual model performance and safety constraints before deploying in critical care settings.

While guidelines exist for ethical AI practices in general, further research and dialogue is needed on responsible best practices specific to EHR data and clinical use cases.

B. Future Directions
This work explores emerging deep learning architectures designed for irregular time series modeling and their application to EHR data for ALL treatment. However, several areas beckon for future research:

Multimodal Learning: Integrating the full scope of multimodal data in EHRs - time series, text notes, images, genomics - to capture a more holistic view of patient state.  

Online/Streaming Learning: Developing techniques for online/streaming learning from newly arrived EHR data to enable continual model refinement over time.

Causal Modeling: Moving beyond predictive modeling to disentangle causal relationships and enable robust counterfactual reasoning about clinical interventions.

Robust Outlier Detection & Uncertainty: Building capabilities for detecting distribution shifts, outlier patterns, and quantifying predictive uncertainty estimates robustly.

Ultimately, by tackling these open challenges at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, we can fully harness the rich potential of EHR data to drive improved clinical outcomes across ALL and other disease areas.
