Task 2:
Prompt: Here is the next sub-task with a prompt for the subagent:

Subtask: Review the thesis outline and provide feedback on areas that need more detail or explanation. Specifically:

1) Identify any sections or bullet points that are unclear or need elaboration. Provide suggestions on what additional information should be included to make those points more comprehensive.

2) Note any important recent papers, architectures, or applications that are missing and should be mentioned in the relevant sections. 

3) Assess the overall flow and structure of the outline. Recommend any changes to the order of sections or bullet points that would improve the logical progression of ideas.

4) Check for any redundancies or unnecessary information that could be condensed or eliminated to keep the thesis focused and concise.

Please compile your feedback and suggestions into a clearly organized list so the outline can be improved and fleshed out into a complete thesis draft. The outline already looks quite strong, so focus your comments on fine-tuning and taking it to the next level rather than major structural changes.
Result: Thanks for providing the additional context on recent research highlighting the importance of AI and deep learning in pharmacogenetics. Based on your prompt, here are my suggestions to improve the thesis outline:

1. Sections/bullets that need more detail:
   - II.A Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - Provide more specifics on how CNNs analyze genomic sequences and examples of the biomarkers they can predict.
   - III. Time Series Models in Pharmacogenetics - Expand on the different time series architectures used beyond just "deep state space models, neural ODEs." Mention any sequence modeling approaches like temporal convolutional networks.
   - IV. Challenges and Future Directions - The "data scarcity" and "interpretability" points need more explanation on why these are challenges and potential solutions.

2. Missing recent papers/architectures:
   - II.B Recurrent Neural Networks - Mention Transformer-RNN hybrid models like Transformers with Augmented Attention.
   - II.C Transformers - PLUS Transformer (Protein Language and Unified Sequence Transformer) for proteogenomics data.
   - Add a subsection on graph neural networks for modeling biological networks and drug-target interactions.

3. Restructuring for better flow:
   - Move "Federated learning for data privacy" from the Challenges section to a new subsection under Deep Learning Architectures, as it is a technique rather than a challenge.
   - Swap the order of sections II and III, as CNNs/RNNs are more fundamental than time series models.

4. Potential redundancies:
   - The "Integration of genomic and clinical data" point under RNNs may be redundant with the challenges point on multi-modal data integration. Consider combining or removing one.

Overall, the outline is quite comprehensive. My suggestions focus on providing more technical depth in certain areas, incorporating the latest research trends, tightening the logical structure, and reducing some redundancy. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!

Task 3:
Prompt: Here is the next sub-task prompt incorporating your helpful feedback:

- Under Time Series Models, include additional architectures like temporal convolutional networks and sequence modeling approaches, beyond just deep state space models and neural ODEs.
- In the Challenges section, further explain why data scarcity and model interpretability are obstacles and suggest potential solutions.

2. Incorporate recent impactful architectures:
- Mention Transformer-RNN hybrid models like Transformers with Augmented Attention in the RNN section. 
- Add PLUS Transformer for proteogenomics data under the Transformers section.
- Create a new subsection on Graph Neural Networks and their applications for modeling biological networks and drug-target interactions. Cite relevant recent papers.

3. Restructure the outline for improved logical flow:
- Create a new subsection under Deep Learning Architectures focusing on federated learning techniques for data privacy, and move the related bullet point there from the Challenges section.
- Reorder sections II and III so that the more fundamental CNN/RNN architectures come before Time Series Models.

4. Eliminate potential redundancies:
- The points about integrating multi-modal data seem to overlap between the RNN and Challenges sections. Combine them to avoid repetition.

After expanding the outline, please review it again to see if it fully captures the main components of an academic thesis on AI and pharmacogenetics. Suggest any final improvements to make it as comprehensive and impactful as possible. If you believe it is sufficiently complete, please begin the response with "The outline is now complete."
