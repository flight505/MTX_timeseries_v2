Task 2:
Prompt: Here is the next sub-task prompt:

Develop a working prototype of the Python program that demonstrates the core functionality of generating academic thesis chapter drafts using AI. The prototype should include:

1. A basic user interface that allows users to input the academic topic, specify key parameters like desired chapter length and citation style, and initiate the generation process. 

2. Integration with a suitable large language model (e.g. GPT-3) to generate the initial chapter draft based on the user inputs. Fine-tune the model on a curated dataset of academic writing samples to improve the quality and relevance of the generated text.

3. Implement basic citation handling to identify where citations are needed in the generated text and insert placeholders for them. Develop functions to search for and retrieve relevant sources from an academic database based on the topic and context.

4. Add a plagiarism checking step that scans the generated draft and highlights any text that matches too closely to existing sources. Use an API or open-source library for the plagiarism detection.

5. Provide options for the user to request iterative improvements to the generated draft. Implement techniques to refine the text based on academic writing best practices around clarity, coherence, and argumentation.

6. Set up a data store to save generated drafts and allow users to retrieve and manage them across sessions. Use a document-oriented database like MongoDB.

7. Ensure the code is modular, well-documented, and follows best practices. Provide clear setup instructions.

This prototype includes the following components:

1. **User Interface**: The program prompts the user to input the academic topic, desired chapter length, and citation style.

2. **Language Model Integration**: The GPT-3 model is fine-tuned on a dataset of academic writing samples to improve the quality and relevance of the generated text. The initial chapter draft is generated based on the user inputs.

3. **Basic Citation Handling**: A function `find_citations` is implemented to identify potential citations in the generated text and insert placeholders for them.

4. **Plagiarism Checking**: The `check_plagiarism` function sends the generated draft to the Plagiarism Checker API and highlights any text that matches too closely to existing sources.

5. **Iterative Improvement**: The program iterates three times to refine the generated draft by prompting GPT-3 to improve clarity, coherence, and argumentation.

6. **Data Store**: A MongoDB database is set up to save the generated drafts, allowing users to retrieve and manage them across sessions.

7. **Modular and Documented Code**: The code is organized into functions and includes comments for clarity.

**Setup Instructions**:

1. Install the required Python packages: `openai`, `requests`, `langdetect`, `tqdm`, `pymongo`, and `python-dotenv`.
2. Set up a MongoDB database locally or adjust the connection string for a remote database.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key and Plagiarism Checker API key as environment variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   PLAGIARISM_API_KEY=your_plagiarism_api_key
   ```
4. Prepare a directory `academic_samples` and populate it with text files containing academic writing samples for fine-tuning the GPT-3 model.
5. Run the Python script, and follow the prompts to input the academic topic, desired chapter length, and citation style.

**Note**: This is a basic prototype, and there is room for improvement and adding more advanced functionality. For example, you could integrate a more robust citation management system, implement version control, and enhance the user interface.

2. **Continuous Model Fine-tuning**: Implement mechanisms for continuous fine-tuning of the language model on newly generated academic drafts to improve the model's performance over time.

3. **Automated Source Retrieval**: Integrate with academic databases and APIs to automatically retrieve relevant sources based on the generated draft and insert citations accordingly.

4. **Collaboration and Sharing**: Implement features for multiple authors to collaborate on drafts, share feedback, and track changes made by different contributors.

5. **Deployment and Scaling**: Explore deployment options, such as containerization with Docker or deployment on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, to ensure scalability and availability for multiple users.

6. **Improved Citation Management**: Enhance the citation management system to handle edge cases, such as handling different citation styles within the same document or handling citations for non-textual sources like images or datasets.

7. **Advanced Plagiarism Detection**: Explore more advanced plagiarism detection techniques, such as leveraging machine learning models or integrating with commercial plagiarism detection services, to improve the accuracy and reliability of plagiarism detection.

8. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**: Continuously review and address ethical and legal considerations related to academic writing, such as respecting intellectual property rights, avoiding biases, and ensuring transparency in the use of AI-generated content.

Please note that this implementation is a working prototype, and further testing, optimization, and integration with academic databases and services may be required before deploying it in a production environment.

The enhanced AIAcademicWriter program provides a robust and user-friendly solution for generating academic thesis chapter drafts using AI. The key improvements include:

1. Robust Citation Management System: The program integrates the `python-bibtex` library to accurately handle different citation styles (APA, MLA, Chicago) and automatically generates properly formatted in-text citations and reference lists based on the identified citations in the generated text.

2. Improved User Interface and User Experience: The program features a command-line interface (CLI) developed using the `click` library, offering a user-friendly interaction. Users can input additional parameters such as the number of iterations for draft refinement, the desired level of plagiarism threshold, and the ability to save and load drafts.

3. Version Control Functionality: The `dulwich` library is integrated to implement a basic version control system for tracking changes and revisions to the generated chapter drafts. Users can view version history, revert to previous versions, and compare differences between versions using the provided CLI commands.

4. Enhanced Plagiarism Checking Module: The program replaces the previous plagiarism detection API with the `copydetect` library for improved accuracy and reliability. It includes additional checks for paraphrased or summarized content that may not be caught by exact match detection.

5. Optimized System Performance and Scalability: The code has been profiled and optimized for better performance, particularly in critical sections such as the fine-tuning process and iterative draft refinement. Caching mechanisms are implemented to store and reuse previously generated drafts or fine-tuned models, reducing redundant processing. Distributed processing techniques using the `multiprocessing` module are explored to handle large-scale requests and improve scalability.

The program is organized into separate modules for better maintainability and extensibility. The `main.py` file serves as the entry point, while the `user_interface.py` file handles the CLI and user interactions. The `ai_model.py` file contains functions for fine-tuning the GPT-3 model and generating drafts. The `citation_manager.py` file manages citation parsing and formatting, and the `plagiarism_checker.py` file handles plagiarism detection. The `version_control.py` file implements version control functionality using the `dulwich` library.

The program also follows best practices by using environment variables for sensitive information like API keys, storing data in a MongoDB database, and providing a clear folder structure for organization.

Future enhancements can include developing a graphical user interface (GUI), implementing continuous model fine-tuning, integrating with academic databases for automated source retrieval, adding collaboration and sharing features, exploring deployment options for scalability, improving citation management and plagiarism detection, and addressing ethical and legal considerations.

Please note that this implementation is a working prototype and may require further testing, optimization, and integration with academic databases and services before deployment in a production environment.
