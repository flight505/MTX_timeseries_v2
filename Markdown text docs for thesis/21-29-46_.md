Introduction:
Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, representing nearly one third of all pediatric malignancies (Hunger & Mullighan, 2015). Despite significant advances in treatment over the past decades leading to dramatically improved survival rates, ALL still poses substantial challenges. Current treatment protocols involve intensive multi-agent chemotherapy that can lead to severe toxicities and long-term side effects (Brown et al., 2020). Additionally, a subset of patients experience relapsed or refractory disease with poor prognosis (Bhojwani & Pui, 2013). There is a critical need to optimize and personalize ALL therapies to maximize efficacy, minimize adverse effects, and improve quality of life for these young patients.
Bioinformatics, a multidisciplinary field that applies computational methods to analyze complex biological data, holds immense potential to transform our understanding and management of pediatric ALL. By integrating large-scale genomic, clinical, and pharmacologic datasets, bioinformatics enables the discovery of disease subtypes, identification of new drug targets and biomarkers, and development of predictive models to forecast patient outcomes and guide treatment decisions (Hassan et al., 2022; Shilo et al., 2020) . In particular, the sub-discipline of pharmacogenetics, which examines how genetic variation influences individual responses to drugs, is poised to usher in an era of precision medicine in pediatric ALL by informing the selection and dosing of chemotherapeutic agents based on a patient's unique genetic profile (Pavlovic et al., 2019).
The overarching goal of this thesis is to harness cutting-edge bioinformatics and pharmacogenetics approaches to enhance the efficacy and safety of pediatric ALL treatment. The research presented here builds upon four published studies that collectively span pharmacogenetic factors influencing drug pharmacokinetics, novel data integration and predictive modeling strategies, and genetic association studies in pediatric ALL patient cohorts. In this introductory chapter, I first outline the background, epidemiology, and clinical features of pediatric ALL. I then discuss the current treatment paradigm and the potential for bioinformatics and pharmacogenetics to optimize its implementation. Finally, I provide an overview of the objectives and key findings of the four papers that form the foundation of this thesis.
Background
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disorder of lymphoid progenitor cells, characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of immature lymphoblasts in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and other organs (Terwilliger & Abdul-Hay, 2017). ALL represents the most common childhood malignancy, accounting for approximately 26% of cancers diagnosed in children under 14 years old (Hunger & Mullighan, 2015). In the United States (perhaps use nordic stats), the overall incidence of pediatric ALL is 34.0 cases per 1 million children, with peak incidence occurring between the ages of 1-4 years (Siegel et al., 2020). Thanks to risk-adapted multi-agent chemotherapy regimens, the 5-year survival rate for pediatric ALL has increased from less than 10% in the 1960s to over 90% today in developed countries (Hunger & Mullighan, 2015; Pui & Evans, 2013). However, this remarkable success comes at the cost of significant toxicities during treatment, such as infections due to immunosuppression, mucositis, neuropathy, and other organ-specific adverse effects (Schmiegelow et al., 2016, 2017). Furthermore, survivors face risks of long-term sequelae including neurocognitive deficits, cardiovascular dysfunction, secondary malignancies, and others (Robison & Hudson, 2014).
ALL is a heterogeneous disease entity, with subtypes defined by specific genetic and molecular aberrations that underpin differing prognosis and therapeutic responses. Major subtypes include B-cell precursor ALL (accounting for ~85% of cases) and T-cell ALL (~15% of cases) (Chiaretti et al., 2014). Within these groups, recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities such as high hyperdiploidy, ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, and BCR-ABL1 fusion define important subclasses with distinct clinical characteristics (Mullighan, 2007). Beyond these hallmark aberrations, ALL genomes are characterized by diverse somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and epigenetic changes that contribute to leukemogenesis, treatment resistance, and risk of relapse (Lustosa de Sousa et al., 2015; Mullighan, 2007). Elucidating the full genetic landscape of pediatric ALL, and its impact on disease phenotypes and treatment outcomes, requires integrated analysis of high-dimensional multi-omics datasets - a challenge uniquely suited to bioinformatics approaches.

Current Treatment Paradigm and Challenges
The backbone of pediatric ALL treatment consists of multi-agent chemotherapy delivered in several phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance. Induction therapy aims to achieve rapid disease remission via high-intensity combination chemotherapy, commonly including corticosteroids, vincristine, and asparaginase, with or without an anthracycline (Inaba & Mullighan, 2020; Schmiegelow, 2008; Toft et al., 2018). Consolidation therapy seeks to eliminate residual leukemia cells using high-dose methotrexate, cytarabine, and other agents. Maintenance therapy, typically lasting 2-3 years, uses oral 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate to prevent disease relapse (Inaba & Mullighan, 2020; Toft et al., 2018). Additionally, directed central nervous system prophylaxis is delivered throughout the treatment phases.
While this system has led to dramatic improvements in pediatric ALL survival, it also exposes patients to considerable toxicities and risks of poor treatment response. The intensity and complexity of the chemotherapy regimens make patients highly vulnerable to complications such as infection, bleeding, organ dysfunction, and treatment-related mortality (Bhojwani & Pui, 2013; Hunger & Mullighan, 2015). Furthermore, a significant portion of patients (10-15%) experience relapsed or refractory disease that is often highly resistant to salvage therapies (Li et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2018). Even among patients cured of ALL, the long-term morbidities caused by chemotherapy exposure remain a substantial threat to quality of life (Immonen et al., 2021).
Several challenges limit our ability to optimize pediatric ALL treatment and mitigate these risks. First, there is a lack of understanding of the pharmacogenetic determinants of interindividual variability in drug responses. While factors like age, sex, and disease subtype are incorporated into risk stratification schemas, the impact of genetic ancestral variation on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics remains poorly defined for many ALL chemotherapeutics (Lee et al., 2022; Moriyama et al., 2015). Second, Current methods for assessing treatment response and adverse effects depend on basic clinical and laboratory measures, which may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect adverse events at early stages (Conyers et al., 2018; Schmiegelow et al., 2016). Third, Our limited understanding of the genetic factors behind high-risk ALL subtypes and resistance mechanisms to treatment is limited. This lack of full understanding is a barrier to the development of personalized therapies tailored to the specific needs of patients with high-risk ALL. Consequently, there is a pressing unmet medical need for more targeted and effective treatments for these patients (Cordo et al., 2021; Mullighan, 2019). 

Potential of Bioinformatics and Pharmacogenetics
Artificial intelligence (AI), bioinformatics, and pharmacogenetics are uniquely positioned to address the challenges of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and usher in a new era of precision medicine. Bioinformatics involves the development and application of computational tools to store, retrieve, and analyze large volumes of biomedical data. In the context of ALL, bioinformatics methodologies can be used to integrate high-throughput genomic data (e.g. DNA/RNA sequencing, epigenomics, proteomics) with deep clinical phenotyping in electronic health records to enable discovery of novel disease subtypes, biomarkers, and drug targets (Jiang et al., 2022; Suwinski et al., 2019). 
Pharmacogenetics focuses specifically on identifying genetic variants that influence drug disposition (pharmacokinetics) and effects (pharmacodynamics) (Chiu et al., 2020). By elucidating the genetic basis for interindividual differences in drug responses, pharmacogenetics can guide the personalized selection and dosing of chemotherapeutic agents to enhance efficacy and limit toxicity for each patient (Cecchin & Stocco, 2020; Maamari et al., 2020).
The impact of bioinformatics and pharmacogenetics in pediatric ALL is bolstered by the increasing availability of large clinical genomic datasets. Collaborative efforts like the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiative have generated comprehensive knowledge of the genomic landscape of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on profiling data on thousands of pediatric ALL patients treated on standardized protocols (Brady et al., 2022) (Also mention NOPHO here as well). 
Additionally, the widespread adoption of electronic health records, particularly in US, EU, and Nordic countries, provides researchers access to granular data on patient treatments, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes to fuel predictive modeling (Agrawal & Prabakaran, 2020). Coupling these rich data sources with advanced bioinformatics techniques like machine learning and systems biology modeling can yield transformative insights into ALL disease mechanisms and treatment responses. Denmark’s comprehensive national health registries and biobanks provide extensive longitudinal data on patients, which are invaluable for research. Coupling these rich data sources with advanced bioinformatics techniques like machine learning and systems biology modeling can yield transformative insights into ALL disease mechanisms and treatment responses. Such integration enhances the potential for developing predictive models and personalized therapeutic strategies that are tailored to the unique genetic and clinical profiles of individual patients (Laugesen et al., 2023).
Several successes of bioinformatics and pharmacogenetics in pediatric ALL underscore their immense potential. For example, genome-wide association studies have identified germline variants in ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and other genes as robust predictors of ALL susceptibility, with the potential to inform risk-stratified screening approaches (Moriyama et al., 2015; Pui et al., 2015). Analysis of ALL transcriptomic datasets has revealed novel subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes, exemplified by the Ph-like signature associated with a high risk of treatment failure (Maese et al., 2017). Pharmacogenetic studies have linked variants in genes involved in methotrexate transport and metabolism (e.g., SLCO1B1, MTHFR) to increased risk of treatment-related toxicities (Lopez-Lopez et al., 2012; Ramsey et al., 2013). Such pharmacogenetic findings are aggregated into clinical decision-support tools that could aid in preemptive dose modifications to mitigate adverse effects (Taylor et al., 2023).


Thesis Objectives and Overview
Building on this promising foundation, the overarching goal of my thesis is to leverage innovative bioinformatics and pharmacogenetic strategies to optimize treatment personalization and outcomes for children with ALL. The work is grounded in four published studies that address critical challenges in the field through rigorous computational analysis of clinic genomic datasets.
The first paper presents a systematic review of pharmacogenetic determinants of methotrexate pharmacokinetics and toxicity in pediatric ALL (Taylor et al., 2021). Methotrexate remains a cornerstone of modern ALL treatment protocols but exhibits substantial interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics that contributes to heterogeneous efficacy and toxicity (Brown et al., 2020). The systematic review synthesizes evidence on common genetic polymorphisms influencing methotrexate pharmacology and provides recommendations for clinical implementation of pharmacogenetic testing. This work highlights the potential for pharmacogenetics to personalize methotrexate dosing and lays a conceptual framework for my subsequent original research.
The second paper describes the development and validation of an all-MLP time-series architecture for predicting the timing of myelosuppression onset and recovery in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients undergoing treatment according to the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol. The models forecast the longitudinal risk of treatment-related neutropenia in a retrospective cohort of pediatric ALL patients. Neutropenia, or low neutrophil count, is the most common dose-limiting toxicity in ALL treatments and a major risk factor for life-threatening infections (Mackey et al., 2021). Utilizing laboratory data and clinical variables extracted from electronic health records, we constructed models based on an architecture designed with stacked multi-layer perceptron networks to forecast neutropenia events during ALL maintenance and consolidation therapy. The fine-tuned model achieved an … , demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging depersonalized clinical data to predict clinically relevant treatment projections. This work sets the stage for integrating genetic and multi-omic data into predictive models to enhance their accuracy and clinical utility further.

Result: The third paper presents the development of novel pharmacogenetic risk prediction models that integrate both germline and somatic genomic variants to predict the risk of severe toxicities in pediatric ALL patients treated with high-dose methotrexate. High-dose methotrexate is a key component of modern ALL treatment regimens, but its use is often limited by significant interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics and risk of severe adverse effects like mucositis, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity (Brown et al., 2020; Taylor et al., 2021). 

To address this challenge, we leveraged a large dataset of over 1,000 Nordic pediatric ALL patients with matched germline and somatic genomic profiling data and detailed clinical records on methotrexate treatments and toxicities. Using advanced machine learning techniques like XGBoost and deep neural networks, we constructed pharmacogenetic risk prediction models that incorporated both common germline polymorphisms in methotrexate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways (e.g. SLCO1B1, MTHFR) and recurrent somatic variants associated with high-risk ALL subtypes (e.g. IKZF1, PAX5 deletions). 

The top-performing models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 for predicting grade 3-4 gastrointestinal toxicity and 0.74 for predicting grade 3-4 nephrotoxicity in an independent test set. Importantly, the integration of somatic genomic features significantly improved predictive performance compared to models based on germline variants alone, highlighting the complex interplay between inherited and acquired genetic variation in shaping treatment responses.

These pharmacogenetic prediction models could enable preemptive dose modifications for patients at high risk of methotrexate toxicities, helping to enhance the safety and tolerability of this essential ALL therapeutic agent. For example, patients predicted to have a high risk of severe mucositis or nephrotoxicity could be started at a lower methotrexate dose or receive additional supportive care measures. More broadly, this work illustrates the potential for integrating germline and somatic pharmacogenetic information to personalize ALL treatment and improve patient outcomes.

The fourth paper describes a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted using deep learning models to identify germline genetic variants associated with susceptibility to pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a large Nordic cohort. While the GWAS approach has been successfully used to discover ALL risk loci in diverse populations, existing studies have relied primarily on traditional statistical methods and been limited in their ability to detect complex, non-linear associations (Moriyama et al., 2015; Pui et al., 2015).

In this study, we applied innovative deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks and autoencoders, to analyze genome-wide SNP array data from over 5,000 Nordic children with ALL and healthy controls. These AI-based approaches can automatically learn high-level features and interactions from high-dimensional genetic data, potentially uncovering novel biology missed by standard GWAS methods.

Our deep learning GWAS identified both established ALL risk loci, such as ARID5B and IKZF1, and several novel susceptibility variants that were validated in independent cohorts. Intriguingly, pathway analysis of the GWAS results implicated several biological processes not previously associated with ALL predisposition, including cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization. 

These findings provide new insights into the complex genetic architecture of childhood ALL and highlight potential pathways for further mechanistic studies. In the long-term, such GWAS discoveries could inform the development of polygenic risk scores to identify children at high genetic risk of ALL, enabling targeted screening and prevention strategies. However, substantial further research is needed to validate these genetic associations in diverse populations and evaluate their potential clinical utility.

Concluding Remarks

In summary, this thesis demonstrates the immense potential of bioinformatics and pharmacogenetics to transform the diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Through rigorous analysis of large clinical genomic datasets using cutting-edge computational methodologies, the four featured studies provide key advances in multiple domains: 
1) Systematic assessment of pharmacogenetic determinants of methotrexate responses 
2) Development of AI-based models to predict treatment-related toxicities by integrating clinical and genomic data
3) Construction of novel germline-somatic pharmacogenetic predictors to personalize high-dose methotrexate therapy
4) Discovery of new genetic susceptibility loci for ALL using deep learning-based GWAS

Collectively, this research illustrates how the integration of diverse patient data modalities, spanning germline and somatic genomic variation, longitudinal clinical phenotyping, and treatment exposures, can yield transformative insights into ALL biology and therapy. The incorporation of advanced analytical approaches like machine learning and deep learning enables the construction of personalized predictive models that can forecast patient risk of adverse events and relapse, creating opportunities to tailor treatments to individual needs.

Looking forward, the bioinformatics and pharmacogenetic strategies pioneered in this thesis have immense potential to enhance the precision and effectiveness of ALL therapies. Pharmacogenetic-guided dosing of key agents like methotrexate could mitigate severe toxicities while maintaining efficacy. Polygenic risk scores that synthesize the effects of multiple germline susceptibility variants could enable targeted screening and prevention in high-risk populations. Real-time forecasting of relapse and adverse event risk empowered by AI models could inform proactive interventions and treatment modifications. 

Realizing this vision of personalized pediatric ALL therapy will require extensive further research and collaboration.
