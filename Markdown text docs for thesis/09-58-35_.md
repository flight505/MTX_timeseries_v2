Introduction:
The systematic review titled "Systematic Review of Pharmacogenetic Factors That Influence High-Dose Methotrexate Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Malignancies" aimed to identify and evaluate the genetic factors that contribute to the variability in methotrexate (MTX) pharmacokinetics in pediatric cancer patients. High-dose MTX is a crucial component of chemotherapy regimens for various pediatric malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and osteosarcoma. However, individual variations in drug response and toxicity can significantly impact treatment outcomes. The study focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in MTX transport, metabolism, and elimination, as these genetic variations can influence MTX pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy. This summary provides an overview of the biological functions of the key genes identified in the systematic review and the potential impact of associated SNPs on MTX pharmacokinetics and pediatric malignancy treatment.

Methylene Tetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR):
The MTHFR gene encodes the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in folate metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a co-substrate for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (Nazki et al., 2014). Folate metabolism is essential for nucleic acid synthesis, DNA repair, and cellular methylation reactions.

The systematic review identified several SNPs in the MTHFR gene associated with altered MTX pharmacokinetics and treatment outcomes in pediatric malignancies. The most well-studied SNPs in MTHFR are C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131). The C677T SNP results in an amino acid substitution (Ala222Val) that reduces the enzyme's activity and thermostability, leading to decreased folate levels and an increased risk of toxicity (Mikkelsen et al., 2011). The A1298C SNP also impacts enzyme activity, although to a lesser extent than the C677T variant (Robien et al., 2005).

Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1 (SLCO1B1):
The SLCO1B1 gene encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), a membrane-bound influx transporter expressed in hepatocytes. OATP1B1 plays a crucial role in the uptake of various endogenous and exogenous compounds, including MTX, into the liver (Mikkelsen et al., 2011).

The systematic review identified the c.521T>C (rs4149056) SNP in the SLCO1B1 gene as a potential determinant of MTX pharmacokinetics in pediatric malignancies. This non-synonymous SNP results in an amino acid substitution (Val174Ala) that can impact the transporter's function and reduce MTX uptake into hepatocytes (Ramsey et al., 2012). Carriers of this SNP may exhibit altered MTX clearance and increased toxicity due to higher systemic exposure.

ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporters:
The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a family of membrane-bound efflux pumps involved in the active transport of various substrates, including drugs, across cellular membranes. The systematic review highlighted the importance of SNPs in the ABCC2 and ABCB1 genes, encoding the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP2) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), respectively, in influencing MTX pharmacokinetics.

The ABCC2 gene encodes the MRP2 transporter, which is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidneys, and intestine. MRP2 plays a crucial role in the biliary excretion of MTX and its metabolites (Breedveld et al., 2007). SNPs in ABCC2, such as the c.1249A>G (rs2273697) and c.3972C>T (rs3740066) variants, have been associated with altered MTX clearance and toxicity profiles in pediatric malignancies (Ramsey et al., 2012).

The ABCB1 gene encodes P-gp, a widely expressed efflux transporter involved in drug resistance and the protection of various tissues from xenobiotics. The c.3435C>T (rs1045642) SNP in ABCB1 has been linked to altered P-gp expression and activity, potentially impacting MTX distribution and elimination (Ramsey et al., 2012).

Relevance to MTX Pharmacokinetics and Pediatric Malignancies:
The systematic review highlights the importance of understanding the genetic factors that influence MTX pharmacokinetics in pediatric cancer patients. Variations in genes involved in MTX transport, metabolism, and elimination can significantly impact drug exposure, leading to inter-individual differences in treatment response and toxicity.

In the context of pediatric malignancies, optimizing MTX dosing and minimizing adverse effects is crucial for improving treatment outcomes and quality of life. Identifying patients with genetic predispositions to altered MTX pharmacokinetics can enable personalized dosing strategies, leading to more effective and safer treatment regimens.

By considering the biological functions of the identified genes and the potential impact of associated SNPs, healthcare professionals can develop targeted therapeutic approaches, such as dose adjustments or alternative treatment options, for patients at risk of suboptimal MTX response or increased toxicity.

Conclusion:
The systematic review "Systematic Review of Pharmacogenetic Factors That Influence High-Dose Methotrexate Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Malignancies" sheds light on the critical role of genetic variations in genes involved in MTX transport, metabolism, and elimination. SNPs in genes such as MTHFR, SLCO1B1, ABCC2, and ABCB1 can significantly impact MTX pharmacokinetics, potentially leading to inter-individual differences in treatment response and toxicity profiles. Understanding the biological functions of these genes and the impact of associated SNPs is essential for optimizing MTX therapy in pediatric malignancies. By incorporating pharmacogenetic considerations into treatment strategies, healthcare professionals can improve treatment outcomes, minimize adverse effects, and enhance the overall quality of life for pediatric cancer patients.

Impact of SNPs on MTX Pharmacokinetics and Pediatric Malignancies:
The systematic review identified several SNPs in the MTHFR, SLCO1B1, ABCC2, and ABCB1 genes that can significantly impact MTX pharmacokinetics and treatment outcomes in pediatric malignancies.

1. MTHFR:
The most well-studied SNPs in MTHFR are C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131).

The A1298C SNP also impacts enzyme activity, although to a lesser extent than the C677T variant (Robien et al., 2005).

2. SLCO1B1:
The c.521T>C (rs4149056) SNP in the SLCO1B1 gene can impair the transporter's function and reduce MTX uptake into hepatocytes (Ramsey et al., 2012). Carriers of this SNP may exhibit altered MTX clearance and increased toxicity due to higher systemic exposure.

3. ABCC2 and ABCB1:
SNPs in ABCC2, such as the c.1249A>G (rs2273697) and c.3972C>T (rs3740066) variants, have been associated with altered MTX clearance and toxicity profiles in pediatric malignancies (Ramsey et al., 2012).
