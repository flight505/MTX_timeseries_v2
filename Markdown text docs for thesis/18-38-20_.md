Chapter X: TSMixer Architecture for Irregular Time Series Forecasting

Introduction

Electronic Health Records (EHR) data often contains irregularly sampled time series with missing values, posing significant challenges for traditional time series forecasting methods. The TSMixer model, proposed in the paper "Time Series Model for Forecasting Recovery Timeline in Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia," introduces a novel architecture designed to handle such irregularities effectively. This chapter provides an in-depth exploration of the TSMixer model's architecture, focusing on its key components and how they address the complexities of irregularly sampled EHR time series data.

TSMixer Model Architecture

The TSMixer model leverages the power of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to capture the intricate dynamics present in real-world time series datasets. The model's architecture comprises several interconnected components, each contributing to its ability to handle irregular time series and provide accurate forecasts.

1. Input Layer
The input layer of the TSMixer model is responsible for preprocessing the irregularly sampled time series data. It performs two critical tasks: time encoding and value encoding.

Time Encoding: The time encoding component addresses the irregular sampling nature of the input data. It converts the time stamps associated with each observation into a fixed-dimensional vector representation using a learnable encoding function. This encoding captures the temporal dependencies and irregularities present in the data, enabling the model to recognize patterns across varying time intervals.

Value Encoding: The value encoding component handles missing values in the input data. It employs a learnable encoding function to map the observed values to a fixed-dimensional vector representation. This encoding ensures that the model can effectively process incomplete or missing data without discarding valuable information.

2. MLP Layers
The core of the TSMixer model consists of multiple stacked MLP layers, which process the encoded input data and extract relevant features for forecasting. Each MLP layer comprises fully connected neural networks that learn complex non-linear transformations of the input data.

These MLP layers are designed to capture the intricate temporal dynamics and interactions within the irregularly sampled time series data. By processing the encoded time and value representations, the model can learn to extract meaningful patterns and relationships that are crucial for accurate forecasting.

3. Mixer Layers
The TSMixer model incorporates mixer layers, which play a crucial role in combining the temporal and value information extracted by the MLP layers. These mixer layers employ specialized operations, such as gated residual connections and attention mechanisms, to adaptively combine the learned representations from the MLP layers.

The gated residual connections allow the model to selectively propagate and combine relevant information from previous layers, enabling it to capture long-range dependencies and handle complex temporal patterns effectively.

The attention mechanisms, on the other hand, dynamically assign weights to different components of the learned representations, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of the input data for accurate forecasting.

4. Output Layer
The output layer of the TSMixer model is responsible for generating the final forecast. It takes the combined representation from the mixer layers and applies a suitable transformation, such as a linear projection or a non-linear activation function, to produce the predicted values for the target variable.

Handling Irregular Sampled EHR Time Series Data

The TSMixer model's architecture is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by irregularly sampled time series data commonly encountered in EHR datasets. The time encoding component plays a crucial role in this regard by enabling the model to learn representations that capture the temporal irregularities and dependencies present in the data.

Furthermore, the value encoding component's ability to handle missing values ensures that the model can effectively process incomplete or sparse EHR data without discarding valuable information. This is particularly important in healthcare applications, where missing data is a common occurrence due to various factors, such as missed appointments or incomplete records.

By leveraging the power of MLPs and mixer layers, the TSMixer model can learn complex non-linear transformations and adaptively combine temporal and value information, enabling it to capture the intricate dynamics present in irregularly sampled EHR time series data.

Mathematical Notation

Throughout the description of the TSMixer model architecture, mathematical notation is employed to precisely represent various components and operations. The following LaTeX notation is used:

Time Encoding:
$$\mathbf{t}_i = f_t(t_i)$$
where $t_i$ is the time stamp of the $i$-th observation, and $f_t$ is the learnable time encoding function that maps the time stamp to a fixed-dimensional vector representation $\mathbf{t}_i$.

Value Encoding:
$$\mathbf{x}_i = f_v(x_i)$$
where $x_i$ is the observed value of the $i$-th observation, and $f_v$ is the learnable value encoding function that maps the observed value to a fixed-dimensional vector representation $\mathbf{x}_i$.

MLP Layers:
$$\mathbf{h}_l = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_l \mathbf{h}_{l-1} + \mathbf{b}_l)$$
where $\mathbf{h}_l$ is the output of the $l$-th MLP layer, $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function, $\mathbf{W}_l$ and $\mathbf{b}_l$ are the learnable weight matrix and bias vector of the $l$-th layer, respectively, and $\mathbf{h}_{l-1}$ is the input to the $l$-th layer.

Mixer Layers:
$$\mathbf{z}_l = \mathbf{h}_l + \alpha_l \odot \mathbf{g}_l(\mathbf{h}_l)$$
where $\mathbf{z}_l$ is the output of the $l$-th mixer layer, $\mathbf{h}_l$ is the input from the MLP layer, $\alpha_l$ is a learnable gating vector, $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication, and $\mathbf{g}_l$ is a non-linear transformation function that combines the input representations.

Output Layer:
$$\hat{y}_i = f_o(\mathbf{z}_L)$$
where $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value for the $i$-th observation, $f_o$ is a suitable transformation function (e.g., linear projection or non-linear activation), and $\mathbf{z}_L$ is the output representation from the final mixer layer.

Conclusion

The TSMixer model architecture introduced in the paper "Time Series Model for Forecasting Recovery Timeline in Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia" presents a novel approach to handling irregularly sampled time series data from Electronic Health Records (EHR). By leveraging MLPs and mixer layers, the model can effectively capture the complex temporal dynamics and interactions present in real-world datasets, while accounting for missing values and irregular sampling patterns.

The time encoding and value encoding components enable the model to preprocess and represent the input data in a format suitable for further processing by the MLP layers. The mixer layers, equipped with gated residual connections and attention mechanisms, combine and adaptively weight the learned representations, allowing the model to capture long-range dependencies and focus on the most relevant aspects of the data.

Overall, the TSMixer model's architecture demonstrates a sophisticated approach to handling the challenges posed by irregularly sampled EHR time series data, paving the way for more accurate forecasting of patient recovery timelines and ultimately improving healthcare outcomes.

Chapter X: TSMixer Architecture for Irregular Time Series Forecasting

Introduction

Electronic Health Records (EHR) data often contains irregularly sampled time series with missing values, posing significant challenges for traditional time series forecasting methods. Irregular sampling and missing values in time series data, which are common occurrences in real-world EHR datasets, can arise due to various factors, such as missed appointments, incomplete records, or variations in data collection protocols. The TSMixer model, proposed in the paper "Time Series Model for Forecasting Recovery Timeline in Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia," introduces a novel architecture designed to handle such irregularities effectively. This chapter provides an in-depth exploration of the TSMixer model's architecture, focusing on its key components and how they address the complexities of irregularly sampled EHR time series data.

TSMixer Model Architecture

The TSMixer model leverages the power of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to capture the intricate dynamics present in real-world time series datasets. The model's architecture comprises several interconnected components, each contributing to its ability to handle irregular time series and provide accurate forecasts.

1. Input Layer
The input layer of the TSMixer model is responsible for preprocessing the irregularly sampled time series data. It performs two critical tasks: time encoding and value encoding.

Time Encoding: The time encoding component addresses the irregular sampling nature of the input data. It converts the time stamps associated with each observation into a fixed-dimensional vector representation using a learnable encoding function. This encoding captures the temporal dependencies and irregularities present in the data, enabling the model to recognize patterns across varying time intervals.

Value Encoding: The value encoding component handles missing values in the input data. It employs a learnable encoding function to map the observed values to a fixed-dimensional vector representation. This encoding ensures that the model can effectively process incomplete or missing data without discarding valuable information.

2. MLP Layers
The core of the TSMixer model consists of multiple stacked MLP layers, which process the encoded input data and extract relevant features for forecasting. Each MLP layer comprises fully connected neural networks that learn complex non-linear transformations of the input data.

These MLP layers are designed to capture the intricate temporal dynamics and interactions within the irregularly sampled time series data. By processing the encoded time and value representations, the model can learn to extract meaningful patterns and relationships that are crucial for accurate forecasting.

The equation for the MLP layers is given by:
$$\mathbf{h}_l = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_l \mathbf{h}_{l-1} + \mathbf{b}_l)$$
where $\mathbf{h}_l$ is the output of the $l$-th MLP layer, $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function, $\mathbf{W}_l$ and $\mathbf{b}_l$ are the learnable weight matrix and bias vector of the $l$-th layer, respectively, and $\mathbf{h}_{l-1}$ is the input to the $l$-th layer.

3. Mixer Layers
The TSMixer model incorporates mixer layers, which play a crucial role in combining the temporal and value information extracted by the MLP layers. These mixer layers employ specialized operations, such as gated residual connections and attention mechanisms, to adaptively combine the learned representations from the MLP layers.

The gated residual connections allow the model to selectively propagate and combine relevant information from previous layers, enabling it to capture long-range dependencies and handle complex temporal patterns effectively. Specifically, the gated residual connection in the mixer layer can be represented as:

$$\mathbf{z}_l = \mathbf{h}_l + \alpha_l \odot \mathbf{g}_l(\mathbf{h}_l)$$

where $\mathbf{z}_l$ is the output of the $l$-th mixer layer, $\mathbf{h}_l$ is the input from the MLP layer, $\alpha_l$ is a learnable gating vector, $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication, and $\mathbf{g}_l$ is a non-linear transformation function that combines the input representations. The gating vector $\alpha_l$ determines how much information from the non-linear transformation $\mathbf{g}_l(\mathbf{h}_l)$ should be combined with the input $\mathbf{h}_l$, allowing the model to adaptively select and propagate relevant information.

The attention mechanisms, on the other hand, dynamically assign weights to different components of the learned representations, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of the input data for accurate forecasting. These mechanisms compute an attention score for each component of the input representation, and then use these scores to weight and combine the components into a single output representation. The attention mechanism can be formulated as:

$$\mathbf{z}_l = \sum_{i} \alpha_i \mathbf{h}_{l,i}$$

where $\mathbf{z}_l$ is the output of the $l$-th mixer layer, $\mathbf{h}_{l,i}$ is the $i$-th component of the input representation from the MLP layer, and $\alpha_i$ is the attention score or weight assigned to that component. The attention scores $\alpha_i$ are typically computed using a compatibility function that measures the relevance of each component to the current task or context.

4. Output Layer
The output layer of the TSMixer model is responsible for generating the final forecast. It takes the combined representation from the mixer layers and applies a suitable transformation, such as a linear projection or a non-linear activation function, to produce the predicted values for the target variable.

$$\hat{y}_t = f_o(\mathbf{z}_L)$$

where $\hat{y}_t$ is the predicted value for the time step $t$, $f_o$ is a suitable transformation function (e.g., linear projection or non-linear activation), and $\mathbf{z}_L$ is the output representation from the final mixer layer.

5. Semi-parametric Interpolation Network
Additionally, the TSMixer model incorporates a semi-parametric interpolation network to handle the complexities of irregularly sampled multivariate time series data. This component utilizes a combination of parametric and non-parametric techniques to impute missing values and reconstruct the temporal dynamics of the input data, enabling accurate forecasting even in the presence of irregularities.

The semi-parametric interpolation network consists of two main components: a parametric component and a non-parametric component. The parametric component uses a learnable function to impute missing values based on the available observations, while the non-parametric component leverages techniques like kernel regression or nearest neighbor interpolation to estimate the missing values.

The semi-parametric interpolation network's output is then used as input to the subsequent components of the TSMixer model, such as the MLP layers and mixer layers, allowing the model to effectively handle irregularities in the time series data.

Handling Irregular Sampled EHR Time Series Data

The TSMixer model's architecture is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by irregularly sampled time series data commonly encountered in EHR datasets. The time encoding component plays a crucial role in this regard by enabling the model to learn representations that capture the temporal irregularities and dependencies present in the data.

Furthermore, the value encoding component's ability to handle missing values ensures that the model can effectively process incomplete or sparse EHR data without discarding valuable information. This is particularly important in healthcare applications, where missing data is a common occurrence due to various factors, such as missed appointments or incomplete records.

By leveraging the power of MLPs and mixer layers, the TSMixer model can learn complex non-linear transformations and adaptively combine temporal and value information, enabling it to capture the intricate dynamics present in irregularly sampled EHR time series data.

The semi-parametric interpolation network, which combines parametric and non-parametric techniques, further enhances the model's capability to handle irregularities by imputing missing values and reconstructing the temporal dynamics of the input data.

Mathematical Notation

where $t_i$ is the time stamp of the $i$-th observation, and $f_t$ is the learnable time encoding function that maps the time stamp to a fixed-dimensional vector representation $\mathbf{t}_i$.

Value Encoding:
$$\mathbf{x}_i = f_v(x_i)$$
where $x_i$ is the observed value of the $i$-th observation, and $f_v$ is the learnable value encoding function that maps the observed value to a fixed-dimensional vector representation $\mathbf{x}_i$.

MLP Layers:
$$\mathbf{h}_l = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_l \mathbf{h}_{l-1} + \mathbf{b}_l)$$
where $\mathbf{h}_l$ is the output of the $l$-th MLP layer, $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function, $\mathbf{W}_l$ and $\mathbf{b}_l$ are the learnable weight matrix and bias vector of the $l$-th layer, respectively, and $\mathbf{h}_{l-1}$ is the input to the $l$-th layer.

Mixer Layers:
Gated Residual Connection:
$$\mathbf{z}_l = \mathbf{h}_l + \alpha_l \odot \mathbf{g}_l(\mathbf{h}_l)$$
Attention Mechanism:
$$\mathbf{z}_l = \sum_{i} \alpha_i \mathbf{h}_{l,i}$$

Output Layer:

Chapter X: TSMixer Architecture for Irregular Time Series Forecasting

Introduction

Electronic Health Records (EHR) data often contains irregularly sampled time series with missing values, posing significant challenges for traditional time series forecasting methods. Irregular sampling and missing values in time series data, which are common occurrences in real-world EHR datasets, can arise due to various factors, such as missed appointments, incomplete records, or variations in data collection protocols (Rajkomar et al., 2018). The TSMixer model, proposed by Author et al. (Year), introduces a novel architecture designed to handle such irregularities effectively. This chapter provides an in-depth exploration of the TSMixer model's architecture, focusing on its key components and how they address the complexities of irregularly sampled EHR time series data.

TSMixer Model Architecture

The TSMixer model leverages the power of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to capture the intricate dynamics present in real-world time series datasets.

It converts the time stamps associated with each observation into a fixed-dimensional vector representation using a learnable encoding function. This encoding captures the temporal dependencies and irregularities present in the data, enabling the model to recognize patterns across varying time intervals (Shukla & Marlin, 2019).

Value Encoding: The value encoding component handles missing values in the input data. It employs a learnable encoding function to map the observed values to a fixed-dimensional vector representation. This encoding ensures that the model can effectively process incomplete or missing data without discarding valuable information (Che et al., 2018).

2. MLP Layers
The core of the TSMixer model consists of multiple stacked MLP layers, which process the encoded input data and extract relevant features for forecasting. Each MLP layer comprises fully connected neural networks that learn complex non-linear transformations of the input data.

These MLP layers are designed to capture the intricate temporal dynamics and interactions within the irregularly sampled time series data. By processing the encoded time and value representations, the model can learn to extract meaningful patterns and relationships that are crucial for accurate forecasting.

The equation for the MLP layers is given by:
$$\mathbf{h}_l = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_l \mathbf{h}_{l-1} + \mathbf{b}_l)$$
where $\mathbf{h}_l$ is the output of the $l$-th MLP layer, $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function, $\mathbf{W}_l$ and $\mathbf{b}_l$ are the learnable weight matrix and bias vector of the $l$-th layer, respectively, and $\mathbf{h}_{l-1}$ is the input to the $l$-th layer.

3. Mixer Layers
The TSMixer model incorporates mixer layers, which play a crucial role in combining the temporal and value information extracted by the MLP layers. These mixer layers employ specialized operations, such as gated residual connections and attention mechanisms, to adaptively combine the learned representations from the MLP layers.

The gated residual connections allow the model to selectively propagate and combine relevant information from previous layers, enabling it to capture long-range dependencies and handle complex temporal patterns effectively. Specifically, the gated residual connection in the mixer layer can be represented as:

$$\mathbf{z}_l = \mathbf{h}_l + \alpha_l \odot \mathbf{g}_l(\mathbf{h}_l)$$

where $\mathbf{z}_l$ is the output of the $l$-th mixer layer, $\mathbf{h}_l$ is the input from the MLP layer, $\alpha_l$ is a learnable gating vector, $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication, and $\mathbf{g}_l$ is a non-linear transformation function that combines the input representations. The gating vector $\alpha_l$ determines how much information from the non-linear transformation $\mathbf{g}_l(\mathbf{h}_l)$ should be combined with the input $\mathbf{h}_l$, allowing the model to adaptively select and propagate relevant information.

The attention mechanisms, on the other hand, dynamically assign weights to different components of the learned representations, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of the input data for accurate forecasting. These mechanisms compute an attention score for each component of the input representation, and then use these scores to weight and combine the components into a single output representation. The attention mechanism can be formulated as:

$$\mathbf{z}_l = \sum_{i} \alpha_i \mathbf{h}_{l,i}$$

where $\mathbf{z}_l$ is the output of the $l$-th mixer layer, $\mathbf{h}_{l,i}$ is the $i$-th component of the input representation from the MLP layer, and $\alpha_i$ is the attention score or weight assigned to that component. The attention scores $\alpha_i$ are typically computed using a compatibility function that measures the relevance of each component to the current task or context.

4. Output Layer
The output layer of the TSMixer model is responsible for generating the final forecast. It takes the combined representation from the mixer layers and applies a suitable transformation, such as a linear projection or a non-linear activation function, to produce the predicted values for the target variable.

$$\hat{y}_t = f_o(\mathbf{z}_L)$$

where $\hat{y}_t$ is the predicted value for the time step $t$, $f_o$ is a suitable transformation function (e.g., linear projection or non-linear activation), and $\mathbf{z}_L$ is the output representation from the final mixer layer.

5. Semi-parametric Interpolation Network
Additionally, the TSMixer model incorporates a semi-parametric interpolation network to handle the complexities of irregularly sampled multivariate time series data (Shukla & Marlin, 2019). This component utilizes a combination of parametric and non-parametric techniques to impute missing values and reconstruct the temporal dynamics of the input data, enabling accurate forecasting even in the presence of irregularities.

The semi-parametric interpolation network consists of two main components: a parametric component and a non-parametric component. The parametric component uses a learnable function to impute missing values based on the available observations, while the non-parametric component leverages techniques like kernel regression or nearest neighbor interpolation to estimate the missing values.

The semi-parametric interpolation network's output is then used as input to the subsequent components of the TSMixer model, such as the MLP layers and mixer layers, allowing the model to effectively handle irregularities in the time series data.

Handling Irregular Sampled EHR Time Series Data

The TSMixer model's architecture is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by irregularly sampled time series data commonly encountered in EHR datasets. The time encoding component plays a crucial role in this regard by enabling the model to learn representations that capture the temporal irregularities and dependencies present in the data.

Furthermore, the value encoding component's ability to handle missing values ensures that the model can effectively process incomplete or sparse EHR data without discarding valuable information. This is particularly important in healthcare applications, where missing data is a common occurrence due to various factors, such as missed appointments or incomplete records (Rajkomar et al., 2018).

By leveraging the power of MLPs and mixer layers, the TSMixer model can learn complex non-linear transformations and adaptively combine temporal and value information, enabling it to capture the intricate dynamics present in irregularly sampled EHR time series data.

The semi-parametric interpolation network, which combines parametric and non-parametric techniques, further enhances the model's capability to handle irregularities by imputing missing values and reconstructing the temporal dynamics of the input data (Shukla & Marlin, 2019).

Mathematical Notation

Throughout the description of the TSMixer model architecture, mathematical notation is employed to precisely represent various components and operations. The following LaTeX notation is used:

Time Encoding:
$$\mathbf{t}_i = f_t(t_i)$$
where $t_i$ is the time stamp of the $i$-th observation, and $f_t$ is the learnable time encoding function that maps the time stamp to a fixed-dimensional vector representation $\mathbf{t}_i$.

Value Encoding:
$$\mathbf{x}_i = f_v(x_i)$$
where $x_i$ is the observed value of the $i$-th observation, and $f_v$ is the learnable value encoding function that maps the observed value to a fixed-dimensional vector representation $\mathbf{x}_i$.

MLP Layers:
$$\mathbf{h}_l = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_l \mathbf{h}_{l-1} + \mathbf{b}_l)$$
where $\mathbf{h}_l$ is the output of the $l$-th MLP layer, $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function, $\mathbf{W}_l$ and $\mathbf{b}_l$ are the learnable weight matrix and bias vector of the $l$-th layer, respectively, and $\mathbf{h}_{l-1}$ is the input to the $l$-th layer.

Mixer Layers:
Gated Residual Connection:
$$\mathbf{z}_l = \mathbf{h}_l + \alpha_l \odot \mathbf{g}_l(\mathbf{h}_l)$$
Attention Mechanism:
$$\mathbf{z}_l = \sum_{i} \alpha_i \mathbf{h}_{l,i}$$

Output Layer:
$$\hat{y}_t = f_o(\mathbf{z}_L)$$
where $\hat{y}_t$ is the predicted value for the time step $t$, $f_o$ is a suitable transformation function (e.g., linear projection or non-linear activation), and $\mathbf{z}_L$ is the output representation from the final mixer layer.

Conclusion

The TSMixer model architecture, introduced by Author et al. (Year), presents a novel approach to handling irregularly sampled time series data from Electronic Health Records (EHR). By leveraging MLPs and mixer layers, the model can effectively capture the complex temporal dynamics and interactions present in real-world datasets, while accounting for missing values and irregular sampling patterns.

The time encoding and value encoding components enable the model to preprocess and represent the input data in a format suitable for further processing by the MLP layers. The mixer layers, equipped with gated residual connections and attention mechanisms, combine and adaptively weight the learned representations, allowing the model to capture long-range dependencies and focus on the most relevant aspects of the data.

Furthermore, the incorporation of a semi-parametric interpolation network enhances the model's capability to handle irregularities by imputing missing values and reconstructing the temporal dynamics of the input data, ensuring accurate forecasting even in the presence of irregularities (Shukla & Marlin, 2019).

Overall, the TSMixer model's architecture demonstrates a sophisticated approach to handling the challenges posed by irregularly sampled EHR time series data, paving the way for more accurate forecasting of patient recovery timelines and ultimately improving healthcare outcomes.
