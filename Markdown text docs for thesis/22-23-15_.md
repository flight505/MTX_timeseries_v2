Overview of TSMixer Architecture

The TSMixer model is a novel deep learning architecture composed entirely of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for multivariate time series forecasting and representation learning. It introduces a new operation called Time Mixing, which mixes information across the time dimension, and leverages the conventional MixerLayer from the MLP-Mixer model (Tolstikhin et al., 2021) to mix information across the feature dimension. This unique combination of mixing operations enables TSMixer to efficiently extract temporal and cross-variable patterns from multivariate time series data.

The overall architecture of TSMixer consists of a series of Time Mixing blocks interleaved with MixerLayers. Each Time Mixing block is composed of a Time Mixing operation followed by an MLP, while each MixerLayer consists of two MLPs and a mixing operation across the feature dimension. This stacking of MLPs with mixing operations along both time and feature dimensions allows TSMixer to capture complex dependencies in the input data.

Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)

Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are a fundamental building block of deep neural networks. An MLP is a fully connected feed-forward neural network that consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons or nodes. Each node in a layer is connected to all nodes in the previous and subsequent layers, but there are no connections between nodes within the same layer.

Mathematically, an MLP with $L$ layers can be represented as a nested function composition:

$$
f(x) = f_L \circ f_{L-1} \circ \dots \circ f_1(x)
$$

where $x$ is the input, $f_i$ is the transformation applied by the $i$-th layer, and $\circ$ denotes the function composition operator.

In the context of TSMixer, each layer $f_i$ is typically an affine transformation followed by a non-linear activation function:

$$
f_i(x) = \sigma(W_i x + b_i)
$$

Here, $W_i$ and $b_i$ are the learnable weights and biases for the $i$-th layer, and $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function such as ReLU or GELU.

Stacking MLPs in TSMixer

In TSMixer, MLPs are stacked in two distinct ways: along the time dimension through Time Mixing blocks, and along the feature dimension through MixerLayers. This stacking approach allows TSMixer to efficiently capture both temporal and cross-variable dependencies in multivariate time series data.

1. Time Mixing Blocks

A Time Mixing block consists of a Time Mixing operation followed by an MLP. The Time Mixing operation mixes information across the time dimension by applying a learnable weight matrix to the input time series data. Specifically, for an input $X \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N}$ with $T$ time steps and $N$ features, the Time Mixing operation computes:

$$
\text{TimeMix}(X) = X W_{\text{time}}
$$

where $W_{\text{time}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times T}$ is a learnable weight matrix that mixes information across the time steps.

After the Time Mixing operation, an MLP is applied to further process the mixed time series data. This MLP operates independently on each time step, allowing it to capture temporal patterns within each time step while preserving the temporal structure of the input.

2. MixerLayers

MixerLayers are inspired by the MLP-Mixer architecture (Tolstikhin et al., 2021) and are responsible for mixing information across the feature dimension. A MixerLayer consists of two MLPs and a mixing operation across the feature dimension.

Given an input $X \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N}$, the first MLP processes the input independently for each feature, generating intermediate representations $X' \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times C}$, where $C$ is the hidden dimension. The mixing operation then mixes information across the feature dimension by applying a learnable weight matrix:

$$
\text{MixerLayer}(X') = X' W_{\text{mix}}
$$

where $W_{\text{mix}} \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times C}$ is a learnable weight matrix that mixes information across the feature dimension.

Finally, the second MLP processes the mixed feature representations to produce the output of the MixerLayer.

By stacking Time Mixing blocks and MixerLayers, TSMixer can effectively capture both temporal and cross-variable dependencies in multivariate time series data, leading to improved forecasting and representation learning performance.

Benefits and Rationale of the All-MLP Architecture

The all-MLP architecture of TSMixer offers several advantages over traditional convolutional or recurrent neural network architectures for time series forecasting:

1. Parallelization: MLPs are inherently parallelizable, as they do not have any recurrent or convolutional operations that introduce sequential dependencies. This makes MLPs more efficient and scalable for processing large-scale time series data.

2. Permutation Equivariance: The mixing operations in TSMixer are permutation equivariant, meaning that the model's output is invariant to permutations of the input features or time steps. This property is desirable for time series data, where the order of features or time steps is often arbitrary or irrelevant.

3. Expressivity: Despite their simplicity, MLPs are universal approximators and can theoretically approximate any continuous function with sufficient depth and width (Hornik et al., 1989). The stacking of MLPs with mixing operations in TSMixer enables the model to capture complex temporal and cross-variable dependencies.

4. Interpretability: The all-MLP architecture of TSMixer is relatively transparent and interpretable compared to other deep learning models with complex operations like convolutions or attention mechanisms. This interpretability can be beneficial in domains where model transparency is crucial, such as healthcare or finance.

5. Efficiency: By avoiding computationally expensive operations like convolutions or recurrent updates, TSMixer can be more efficient and require fewer computational resources than traditional time series models, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications.

In summary, the all-MLP architecture of TSMixer, with its stacking of Time Mixing blocks and MixerLayers, provides a powerful and efficient approach for multivariate time series forecasting and representation learning, offering advantages in terms of parallelization, permutation equivariance, expressivity, interpretability, and efficiency.

Title: Stacking Multi-Layer Perceptrons in the TSMixer Time Series Forecasting Model

Introduction
The TSMixer model is an innovative deep learning architecture designed for multivariate time series forecasting and representation learning. It is composed entirely of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and introduces a new operation called Time Mixing, which mixes information across the time dimension. TSMixer also leverages the conventional MixerLayer from the MLP-Mixer model (Tolstikhin et al., 2021) to mix information across the feature dimension. This unique combination of mixing operations allows TSMixer to efficiently extract temporal and cross-variable patterns from multivariate time series data.

Overview of TSMixer Architecture
The overall architecture of TSMixer consists of a series of Time Mixing blocks interleaved with MixerLayers. Each Time Mixing block is composed of a Time Mixing operation followed by an MLP, while each MixerLayer consists of two MLPs and a mixing operation across the feature dimension. This stacking of MLPs with mixing operations along both time and feature dimensions enables TSMixer to capture complex dependencies in the input data.

Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)
Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are a fundamental building block of deep neural networks. An MLP is a fully connected feed-forward neural network that consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons or nodes. Each node in a layer is connected to all nodes in the previous and subsequent layers, but there are no connections between nodes within the same layer.

Mathematically, an MLP with $L$ layers can be represented as a nested function composition:

$$
f(x) = f_L \circ f_{L-1} \circ \dots \circ f_1(x)
$$

where $x$ is the input, $f_i$ is the transformation applied by the $i$-th layer, and $\circ$ denotes the function composition operator.

In the context of TSMixer, each layer $f_i$ is typically an affine transformation followed by a non-linear activation function:

$$
f_i(x) = \sigma(W_i x + b_i)
$$

Here, $W_i$ and $b_i$ are the learnable weights and biases for the $i$-th layer, and $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function such as ReLU or GELU.

Stacking MLPs in TSMixer
In TSMixer, MLPs are stacked in two distinct ways: along the time dimension through Time Mixing blocks, and along the feature dimension through MixerLayers. This stacking approach allows TSMixer to efficiently capture both temporal and cross-variable dependencies in multivariate time series data.

1. Time Mixing Blocks
A Time Mixing block consists of a Time Mixing operation followed by an MLP. The Time Mixing operation mixes information across the time dimension by applying a learnable weight matrix to the input time series data. Specifically, for an input $X \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N}$ with $T$ time steps and $N$ features, the Time Mixing operation computes:

$$
\text{TimeMix}(X) = X W_{\text{time}}
$$

where $W_{\text{time}} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times T}$ is a learnable weight matrix that mixes information across the time steps.

After the Time Mixing operation, an MLP is applied to further process the mixed time series data. This MLP operates independently on each time step, allowing it to capture temporal patterns within each time step while preserving the temporal structure of the input.

2. MixerLayers
MixerLayers are inspired by the MLP-Mixer architecture (Tolstikhin et al., 2021) and are responsible for mixing information across the feature dimension. A MixerLayer consists of two MLPs and a mixing operation across the feature dimension.

Given an input $X \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times N}$, the first MLP processes the input independently for each feature, generating intermediate representations $X' \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times C}$, where $C$ is the hidden dimension. The mixing operation then mixes information across the feature dimension by applying a learnable weight matrix:

$$
\text{MixerLayer}(X') = X' W_{\text{mix}}
$$

where $W_{\text{mix}} \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times C}$ is a learnable weight matrix that mixes information across the feature dimension.

Finally, the second MLP processes the mixed feature representations to produce the output of the MixerLayer.

Benefits and Rationale of the All-MLP Architecture
The all-MLP architecture of TSMixer offers several advantages over traditional convolutional or recurrent neural network architectures for time series forecasting:

1. Parallelization: MLPs are inherently parallelizable, as they do not have any recurrent or convolutional operations that introduce sequential dependencies. This makes MLPs more efficient and scalable for processing large-scale time series data.

The stacking of MLPs with mixing operations in TSMixer enables the model to capture complex temporal and cross-variable dependencies.

4. Interpretability: The all-MLP architecture of TSMixer is relatively transparent and interpretable compared to other deep learning models with complex operations like convolutions or attention mechanisms. This interpretability can be beneficial in domains where model transparency is crucial, such as healthcare or finance.

5. Efficiency: By avoiding computationally expensive operations like convolutions or recurrent updates, TSMixer can be more efficient and require fewer computational resources than traditional time series models, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications.

Conclusion
In summary, the all-MLP architecture of TSMixer, with its stacking of Time Mixing blocks and MixerLayers, provides a powerful and efficient approach for multivariate time series forecasting and representation learning. By leveraging the strengths of MLPs and introducing novel mixing operations along both time and feature dimensions, TSMixer offers advantages in terms of parallelization, permutation equivariance, expressivity, interpretability, and efficiency. This makes TSMixer a promising model for a wide range of time series forecasting tasks across various domains.
