Quantification Method for Methotrexate Levels
The systematic review by Walling et al. (2017) examined studies that utilized various methods to quantify methotrexate levels in pediatric cancer patients receiving high-dose methotrexate therapy. The most commonly employed technique was liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). LC-MS/MS allows for highly sensitive and specific quantification of methotrexate concentrations in biological matrices such as plasma or serum (Hawcutt et al., 2013). This method involves separating the analyte (methotrexate) from other components in the sample using liquid chromatography, followed by ionization and detection by mass spectrometry.

Several studies included in the review also used immunoassay methods, such as enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) or fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA), to measure methotrexate levels (Walling et al., 2017). These techniques rely on the binding of methotrexate to specific antibodies, with the degree of binding being proportional to the methotrexate concentration in the sample.

Genotyping Methods
The systematic review investigated the influence of genetic polymorphisms on methotrexate pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients. To determine the genotypes of patients, the included studies employed various genotyping methods, primarily polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques.

Several studies used real-time PCR or allelic discrimination assays, which involve amplifying and detecting specific gene sequences associated with the polymorphisms of interest (Walling et al., 2017). These methods allow for the discrimination of different alleles or genotypes based on the presence or absence of fluorescent signals corresponding to the target sequences.

Other studies utilized PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, which involves amplifying the gene region of interest, followed by digestion with specific restriction enzymes that cleave the DNA at specific sites based on the genotype (Walling et al., 2017). The resulting DNA fragments are then separated by gel electrophoresis, and the genotypes are determined based on the banding patterns.

Key Pharmacokinetic Endpoints Analyzed
The systematic review focused on pharmacokinetic endpoints relevant to high-dose methotrexate therapy in pediatric cancer patients. The key endpoints analyzed included:

1. Methotrexate clearance: Several studies evaluated the influence of genetic factors on methotrexate clearance, which is a critical parameter determining the elimination rate and exposure to the drug (Walling et al., 2017).

2. Methotrexate concentrations at specific timepoints after dosing: Many studies examined methotrexate concentrations at various timepoints (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours) after the administration of high-dose methotrexate, as these concentrations are related to the drug's efficacy and toxicity (Walling et al., 2017).

3. Delayed methotrexate elimination: Several studies investigated the impact of genetic factors on the risk of delayed methotrexate elimination, which is defined as methotrexate concentrations above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.1 μM or 0.4 μM) at a specified timepoint (e.g., 48 or 72 hours) after administration (Walling et al., 2017). Delayed elimination can increase the risk of methotrexate-related toxicities.

Potential Improvements and Suggestions
While the systematic review provided a comprehensive overview of the existing literature, the authors acknowledged some limitations and areas for improvement in future research:

1. Standardization of analytical methods: The authors noted the need for standardized and validated analytical methods for methotrexate quantification across studies to ensure comparability and reliable interpretation of results (Walling et al., 2017).

2. Inclusion of diverse populations: Many of the included studies were conducted in predominantly Caucasian populations. Future research should aim to include more diverse ethnic groups to better understand the potential influence of genetic variations across different populations (Walling et al., 2017).

3. Comprehensive genotyping: While the review focused on selected genetic polymorphisms, the authors suggested that future studies should consider a more comprehensive evaluation of genetic variations, including the use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, to identify novel genetic markers influencing methotrexate pharmacokinetics (Walling et al., 2017).

4. Larger sample sizes and prospective studies: Some of the included studies had relatively small sample sizes, which may have limited the statistical power to detect significant associations between genetic factors and pharmacokinetic parameters. The authors recommended conducting larger, prospective studies to validate the findings and improve the reliability of the results (Walling et al., 2017).

Overall, the systematic review provided a valuable synthesis of the existing literature on pharmacogenetic factors influencing methotrexate pharmacokinetics in pediatric cancer patients receiving high-dose therapy. The authors highlighted the need for standardized methodologies, diverse study populations, comprehensive genotyping approaches, and larger prospective studies to advance our understanding of this critical area of research.

Title: Systematic Review of Pharmacogenetic Factors That Influence High-Dose Methotrexate Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Malignancies: Study Design and Methodologies

Introduction
High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is a cornerstone of treatment for various pediatric malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and osteosarcoma (Walling et al., 2017). However, the pharmacokinetics of HD-MTX can vary significantly among patients, leading to differences in efficacy and toxicity. Pharmacogenetic factors, such as genetic polymorphisms in enzymes involved in methotrexate metabolism and transport, have been suggested to contribute to this variability (Hawcutt et al., 2013). The systematic review by Walling et al. (2017) aimed to synthesize the existing literature on pharmacogenetic factors influencing HD-MTX pharmacokinetics in pediatric cancer patients.

Quantification Methods for Methotrexate Levels
The studies included in the systematic review utilized various methods to quantify methotrexate levels in pediatric cancer patients receiving HD-MTX therapy. The most commonly employed technique was liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), which allows for highly sensitive and specific quantification of methotrexate concentrations in biological matrices such as plasma or serum (Hawcutt et al., 2013). Several studies also used immunoassay methods, such as enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) or fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA), to measure methotrexate levels (Walling et al., 2017).

Genotyping Methods
To determine the genotypes of patients, the included studies primarily employed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques. Several studies used real-time PCR or allelic discrimination assays, which involve amplifying and detecting specific gene sequences associated with the polymorphisms of interest (Walling et al., 2017). Other studies utilized PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, which involves amplifying the gene region of interest, followed by digestion with specific restriction enzymes that cleave the DNA at specific sites based on the genotype (Walling et al., 2017).

Key Pharmacokinetic Endpoints Analyzed
The systematic review focused on several key pharmacokinetic endpoints relevant to HD-MTX therapy in pediatric cancer patients. These included methotrexate clearance, methotrexate concentrations at specific timepoints after dosing, and delayed methotrexate elimination (Walling et al., 2017). Delayed elimination, defined as methotrexate concentrations above a certain threshold at a specified timepoint after administration, can increase the risk of methotrexate-related toxicities.

Potential Improvements and Suggestions
The authors acknowledged some limitations and areas for improvement in future research. They noted the need for standardized and validated analytical methods for methotrexate quantification across studies to ensure comparability and reliable interpretation of results (Walling et al., 2017). Additionally, they suggested that future research should aim to include more diverse ethnic groups to better understand the potential influence of genetic variations across different populations.

The authors also recommended that future studies consider a more comprehensive evaluation of genetic variations, including the use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, to identify novel genetic markers influencing methotrexate pharmacokinetics (Walling et al., 2017). Finally, they emphasized the importance of conducting larger, prospective studies to validate the findings and improve the reliability of the results.

Conclusion
The systematic review by Walling et al. (2017) provided a valuable synthesis of the existing literature on pharmacogenetic factors influencing HD-MTX pharmacokinetics in pediatric cancer patients. The authors highlighted the various quantification and genotyping methods employed in the included studies and discussed the key pharmacokinetic endpoints analyzed. They also identified potential areas for improvement in future research, such as standardization of analytical methods, inclusion of diverse populations, comprehensive genotyping approaches, and larger prospective studies. Addressing these aspects will contribute to advancing our understanding of the role of pharmacogenetics in optimizing HD-MTX therapy for pediatric cancer patients.
